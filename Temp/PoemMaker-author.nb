       "I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE Alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures \
or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \
\"without pictures or conversations?\" So she was considering in her own mind \
(as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of \
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink \
eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did \
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took \
a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out \
of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was \
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In \
another moment, down went Alice after it! The rabbit-hole went straight on \
like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that \
Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found \
herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Either the well was \
very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went \
down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, \
but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well \
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and \
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one \
of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to \
her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so \
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Down, down, \
down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so \
Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I \
should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of \
milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\" Alice \
felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon \
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit \
hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark \
overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still \
in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went \
Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a \
corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close \
behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be \
seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of \
lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but they \
were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the \
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she \
was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of \
solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first \
idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! \
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, \
it would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came \
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little \
door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, \
and to her great delight, it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it \
led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and \
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she \
longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of \
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a \
telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\" Alice went back to \
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a \
book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a \
little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said Alice), \
and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \
\"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. \"No, I'll look \
first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not,\" for she \
had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is \
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle \
was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it \
very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, \
roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off. * \
* * * * \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like \
a telescope!\" And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and \
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \
going through the little door into that lovely garden. After awhile, finding \
that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; \
but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had \
forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, \
she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with \
trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \"Come, there's no use in \
crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather sharply. \"I advise you to \
leave off this minute!\" She generally gave herself very good advice (though \
she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely \
as to bring tears into her eyes. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that \
was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, \
on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, \
I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the \
key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either \
way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\" She ate a \
little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which way?\" holding \
her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she \
was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to \
work and very soon finished off the cake. II--THE POOL OF TEARS \"Curiouser \
and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment \
she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I'm opening out like the \
largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I \
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\" Just at this \
moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now \
rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden \
key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she \
could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one \
eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began \
to cry again. She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large \
pool all 'round her and reaching half down the hall. After a time, she heard \
a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to \
see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, \
with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He \
came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the \
Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\" \
When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you \
please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves \
and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice \
took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went \
on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday \
things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got up this morning? \
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, \
_that's_ the great puzzle!\" As she said this, she looked down at her hands \
and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white \
kid-gloves while she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she \
thought. \"I must be growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table \
to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and \
was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was \
the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save \
herself from shrinking away altogether. \"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said \
Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find \
herself still in existence. \"And now for the garden!\" And she ran with all \
speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and \
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \"Things are \
worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this \
before, never!\" As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another \
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that \
she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was \
in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. Just \
then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and \
she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a \
mouse that had slipped in like herself. \"Would it be of any use, now,\" \
thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down \
here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no \
harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this \
pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at \
her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little \
eyes, but it said nothing. \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought \
Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the \
Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"O\[CapitalATilde]\.b9 est ma chatte?\" \
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a \
sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, \
I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor \
animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\" \"Not like \
cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like \
cats, if you were me?\" \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \
\"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I \
think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a \
dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it \
must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather \
not.\" \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of \
its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ \
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\" \"I \
won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of \
conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice \
little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats \
and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended \
it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, \
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly \
after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or \
dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned \
'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in \
a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my \
history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\" It was high \
time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals \
that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, \
and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party \
swam to the shore. III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE They were indeed a \
queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled \
feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping \
wet, cross and uncomfortable. The first question, of course, was how to get \
dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it \
seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, \
as if she had known them all her life. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a \
person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and \
listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, \
in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with \
an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. \
Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was \
favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted \
leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. \
Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\" \"Ugh!\" said the \
Lory, with a shiver. \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of \
Canterbury, found it advisable'--\" \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck. \"Found \
_it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' \
means.\" \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said \
the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the \
archbishop find?\" The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went \
on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and \
offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, \
turning to Alice as it spoke. \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy \
tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\" \"In that case,\" said the Dodo \
solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the \
immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\" \"Speak English!\" said the \
Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's \
more, I don't believe you do either!\" \"What I was going to say,\" said the \
Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a \
Caucus-race.\" \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice. \"Why,\" said the \
Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a \
race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along \
the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but \
they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it \
was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called \
out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and \
asking, \"But who has won?\" This question the Dodo could not answer without \
a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ \
must have prizes.\" \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of \
voices asked. \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice \
with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, \
in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\" Alice had no idea what to do, and in \
despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits \
(luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as \
prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round. The next thing was to eat \
the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds \
complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and \
had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down \
again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. \"You \
promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you \
hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be \
offended again. \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to \
Alice and sighing. \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking \
down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she \
kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of \
the tale was something like this:-- \"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in \
the house, 'Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-- Come, I'll \
take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing \
to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or \
judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said \
cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\" \
\"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you \
thinking of?\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got \
to the fifth bend, I think?\" \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" \
said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \"Please come back and finish \
your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \
\"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker. \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This \
caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off \
at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \
\"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various \
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone. \"I wish I hadn't \
mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the \
best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very \
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little \
pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly. IV--THE \
RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back \
again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; \
Alice heard it muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear \
paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are \
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a \
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and \
she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere \
to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and \
the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished \
completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an \
angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\" \"He took me \
for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be \
when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little \
house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. \
RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, \
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the \
house before she had found the fan and gloves. By this time, Alice had found \
her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan \
and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a \
pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell \
upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and \
put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large \
again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\" \
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the \
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put \
down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any \
more.\" Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing \
and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, \
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up \
the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. \
What _will_ become of me?\" Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had \
now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard \
a voice outside and stopped to listen. \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the \
voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Then came a little pattering of \
feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and \
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now \
about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid \
of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as \
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that \
attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll go 'round \
and get in at the window.\" \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after \
waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she \
suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get \
hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of \
broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had \
fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort. Next came an angry \
voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And then a voice she had \
never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\" \
\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the \
window?\" \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\" \"Well, it's got no business \
there, at any rate; go and take it away!\" There was a long silence after \
this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread \
out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were \
_two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll \
do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish \
they _could_!\" She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At \
last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many \
voices all talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other \
ladder? Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to \
go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master \
says you've got to go down the chimney!\" Alice drew her foot as far down the \
chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and \
scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick \
and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a \
general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch \
him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence and then another confusion of \
voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--What happened to \
you?\" Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No \
more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me like a \
Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" After a minute or two of \
silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A \
barrowful will do, to begin with.\" \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. \
But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles \
came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice \
noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little \
cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I \
eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in \
my size.\" So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that \
she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through \
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals \
and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she \
appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in \
a thick wood. \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as \
she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the \
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to \
eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'\" Alice \
looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could \
not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same \
height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the \
edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was \
sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. V--ADVICE FROM A \
CATERPILLAR At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice. \"Who are _you_?\" said the \
Caterpillar. Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at \
present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think \
I must have changed several times since then.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \
said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain yourself!\" \"I can't explain \
_myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm not myself, you \
see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\" She drew \
herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you ought to tell me who _you_ \
are, first.\" \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar. As Alice could not think of any \
good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of \
mind, she turned away. \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \
\"I've something important to say!\" Alice turned and came back again. \"Keep \
your temper,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing \
down her anger as well as she could. \"No,\" said the Caterpillar. It \
unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you \
think you're changed, do you?\" \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I \
can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten \
minutes together!\" \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar. \
\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one \
doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_ \
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a \
wretched height to be.\" \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the \
Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three \
inches high). In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom \
and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side \
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\" \
\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to herself. \
\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; \
and in another moment, it was out of sight. Alice remained looking \
thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the \
two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they \
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. \"And now which is \
which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to \
try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her \
chin--it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very \
sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to \
eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot \
that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and \
managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.... \"Come, my head's free \
at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an \
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of \
green leaves that lay far below her. \"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And \
oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\" She was delighted to find \
that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She \
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to \
dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a \
large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its \
wings. \"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon. \"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice \
indignantly. \"Let me alone!\" \"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've \
tried banks, and I've tried hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those \
serpents! There's no pleasing them!\" Alice was more and more puzzled. \"As \
if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon, \"but I \
must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken \
the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a \
shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they \
must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\" \"But I'm _not_ \
a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a little girl,\" she \
added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone \
through that day. \"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" \
said the Pigeon; \"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl \
or a serpent?\" \"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but \
I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want \
_yours_--I don't like them raw.\" \"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in \
a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down \
among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled \
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. \
After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her \
hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at \
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had \
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since \
she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at \
first. \"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that \
to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open \
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\
\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size; why, I \
should frighten them out of their wits!\" She did not venture to go near the \
house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. VI--PIG AND \
PEPPER For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she \
would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his \
knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and \
large eyes like a frog. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his \
arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn \
tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The \
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An \
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low and \
their curls got entangled together. When Alice next peeped out, the \
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, \
staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door and \
knocked. \"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that \
for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; \
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly \
hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on \
within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great \
crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \"How am I to get \
in?\" asked Alice. \"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's \
the first question, you know.\" Alice opened the door and went in. The door \
led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the \
other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing \
a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which \
seemed to be full of soup. \"There's certainly too much pepper in that \
soup!\" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. Even the \
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and \
howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the \
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was \
grinning from ear to ear. \"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why your cat grins like that?\" \"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the \
Duchess, \"and that's why.\" \"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always \
grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice. \"You \
don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\" Just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came \
first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess \
took no notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so \
much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or \
not. \"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and \
down in an agony of terror. \"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" \
the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go \
and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the \
room. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped \
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I \
don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to kill \
it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She said the \
last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply. \"If you're going \
to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have nothing more to do \
with you. Mind now!\" Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, \
what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted \
again so violently that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This \
time there could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than \
a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it \
trot away quietly into the wood. Alice was a little startled by seeing the \
Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only \
grinned when it saw her. \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \
\"would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?\" \"In _that_ \
direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives a Hatter; and \
in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit \
either you like; they're both mad.\" \"But I don't want to go among mad \
people,\" Alice remarked. \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're \
all mad here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\" \"I should like it \
very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited yet.\" \"You'll see me \
there,\" said the Cat, and vanished. Alice had not gone much farther before \
she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; it was so large a house \
that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the \
left-hand bit of mushroom. VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY There was a table set out \
under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were \
having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep. The table \
was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. \
\"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \"There's \
_plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large \
arm-chair at one end of the table. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on \
hearing this, but all he said was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\" \
\"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she \
added aloud. \"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to \
it?\" said the March Hare. \"Exactly so,\" said Alice. \"Then you should say \
what you mean,\" the March Hare went on. \"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \
\"at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.\" \
\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be \
talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I \
sleep when I breathe!'\" \"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the \
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its \
head impatiently and said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; \
just what I was going to remark myself.\" \"Have you guessed the riddle \
yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \"No, I give it up,\" Alice \
replied. \"What's the answer?\" \"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the \
Hatter. \"Nor I,\" said the March Hare. Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think \
you might do something better with the time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in \
asking riddles that have no answers.\" \"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare \
said to Alice, very earnestly. \"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an \
offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\" \"You mean you can't take _less_,\" \
said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\" At this, \
Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither \
of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once \
or twice; the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse \
into the tea-pot. \"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, \
as she picked her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever \
was at in all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the \
trees had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \
\"I think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went. Once more she found \
herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. Taking the \
little golden key, she unlocked the door that led into the garden. Then she \
set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her \
pocket) till she was about a foot high; then she walked down the little \
passage; and _then_--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among \
the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET \
GROUND A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses \
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily \
painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as she \
stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\" Five and Seven said nothing, \
but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, \
Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one \
in by mistake; and, if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our \
heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she \
comes, to--\" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the \
garden, called out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners \
instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many \
footsteps and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten \
soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the \
ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came \
the royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next \
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the \
White Rabbit. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on \
a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING \
AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all \
stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She \
said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \"My name \
is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely; but she added \
to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!\" \"Can you play \
croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for Alice. \
\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly. \"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen. \"It's--it's \
a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by the White \
Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \"Very,\" said Alice. \
\"Where's the Duchess?\" \"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under \
sentence of execution.\" \"What for?\" said Alice. \"She boxed the Queen's \
ears--\" the Rabbit began. \"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a \
voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling \
up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and \
the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious \
croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls \
were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to \
double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. \
The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all \
the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen \
was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, \"Off with his \
head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute. \"They're \
dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the great wonder \
is that there's anyone left alive!\" She was looking about for some way of \
escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. \"It's the \
Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself; \"now I shall have somebody to talk \
to.\" \"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat. \"I don't think they play at \
all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; \"and they all \
quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to \
have any rules in particular.\" \"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat \
in a low voice. \"Not at all,\" said Alice. Alice thought she might as well \
go back and see how the game was going on. So she went off in search of her \
hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which \
seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the \
other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other \
side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of \
way, to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under \
her arm, that it might not escape again. Just then Alice ran across the \
Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her arm affectionately into \
Alice's and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper. She was a little startled, however, when she heard the \
voice of the Duchess close to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my \
dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\" \"The game's going on rather \
better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. \
\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love, \
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'\" \"Somebody said,\" Alice \
whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding his own business!\" \"Ah, \
well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her sharp \
little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of _that_ \
is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.'\" \
To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers began \
to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them, with \
her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm! \"Now, I give you fair \
warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke, \"either \
you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your \
choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \"Let's go \
on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much \
frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. \
All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with the \
other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" \
By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the King, the Queen \
and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution. \
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with Alice. \
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You are \
all pardoned.\" Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the \
distance, and Alice ran along with the others. IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS? The \
King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with \
a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as \
well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in \
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the \
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the \
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of \
tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" Alice thought, \"and \
hand 'round the refreshments!\" The judge, by the way, was the King and he \
wore his crown over his great wig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \
\"and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I \
suppose they are the jurors.\" Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence \
in the court!\" \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King. On this, the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the \
parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some \
tarts, All on a summer day; The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And \
took them quite away!\" \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First \
witness!\" The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one \
hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. \"You ought to have \
finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\" The Hatter looked at the \
March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the \
Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\" he said. \"Give your \
evidence,\" said the King, \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed \
on the spot.\" This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept \
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in \
his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread \
and butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was \
beginning to grow larger again. The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and \
bread and butter and went down on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" \
he began. \"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King. \"You may go,\" \
said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court. \"Call the next \
witness!\" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She \
carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began \
sneezing all at once. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King. \"Sha'n't,\" \
said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a \
low voice, \"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\" \"Well, if I \
must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\" \"Pepper, \
mostly,\" said the cook. For some minutes the whole court was in confusion \
and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \
\"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\" Alice watched the \
White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read \
out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"Alice!\" X--ALICE'S \
EVIDENCE \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below. \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay. \
\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are back \
in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking \
hard at Alice. \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to \
Alice. \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice. The King then read from his book: \
\"Rule forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\" \
\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice. \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the \
Queen. \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice. The King turned pale \
and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your verdict,\" he said to the \
jury, in a low, trembling voice. \"There's more evidence to come yet, please \
Your Majesty,\" said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This \
paper has just been picked up. It seems to be a letter written by the \
prisoner to--to somebody.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It \
isn't a letter, after all; it's a set of verses.\" \"Please, Your Majesty,\" \
said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; there's \
no name signed at the end.\" \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else \
you'd have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a \
general clapping of hands at this. \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the \
White Rabbit. There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit \
read out the verses. \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've \
heard yet,\" said the King. \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in \
it,\" ventured Alice. \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that \
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the \
jury consider their verdict.\" \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence \
first--verdict afterwards.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The \
idea of having the sentence first!\" \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, \
turning purple. \"I won't!\" said Alice. \"Off with her head!\" the Queen \
shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \"Who cares for _you_?\" said \
Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). \"You're nothing but a \
pack of cards!\" At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying \
down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, \
and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her \
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves \
that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \"Wake up, Alice \
dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've had!\" \"Oh, I've \
had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as \
she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have \
just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as \
well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.", $CellContext`textProc = 
       "i down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or \
conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without \
pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as \
she could for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the \
pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and \
picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by \
her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so \
very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i \
shall be too late but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its \
waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her \
feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit \
with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with \
curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it \
pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went \
alice after it the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way \
and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to \
think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what \
seemed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very \
slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her first \
she tried to make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see \
anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were \
filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and \
pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she \
passed it was labeled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was \
empty she did not like to drop the jar so managed to put it into one of the \
cupboards as she fell past it down down down would the fall never come to an \
end there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking to herself dinah \
ll miss me very much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope they ll \
remember her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down \
here with me alice felt that she was dozing off when suddenly thump thump \
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over \
alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up in a moment she looked up but it \
was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white \
rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost \
away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it \
turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting she was close \
behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen \
she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps \
hanging from the roof there were doors all round the hall but they were all \
locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other \
trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever \
to get out again suddenly she came upon a little table all made of solid \
glass there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alice s first idea \
was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either \
the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would \
not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low \
curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about \
fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her \
great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a \
small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along \
the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out \
of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and \
those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway \
oh said alice how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if \
i only knew how to begin alice went back to the table half hoping she might \
find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up \
like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was \
not here before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper \
label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters no i \
ll look first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not for she had \
never forgotten that if you drink from a bottle marked poison it is almost \
certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not \
marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had a \
sort of mixed flavor of cherry tart custard pineapple roast turkey toffy and \
hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off what a curious feeling said \
alice i must be shutting up like a telescope and so it was indeed she was now \
only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was \
now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden \
after awhile finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the \
garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she \
had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for \
it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying \
the poor little thing sat down and cried come there s no use in crying like \
that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this \
minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom \
followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears \
into her eyes soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under \
the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words \
eat me were beautifully marked in currants well i ll eat it said alice and if \
it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i \
can creep under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i don t \
care which happens she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which \
way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she \
was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same \
size so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake ii the pool of \
tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for \
the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now i m opening out \
like the largest telescope that ever was good by feet oh my poor little feet \
i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears i shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you just at this moment \
her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now rather more \
than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried \
off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down \
on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through \
was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again she went on \
shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her and \
reaching half down the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet \
in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was \
the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves \
in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great \
hurry muttering to himself oh the duchess the duchess oh won t she be savage \
if i ve kept her waiting when the rabbit came near her alice began in a low \
timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white \
kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he \
could go alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all \
the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day and \
yesterday things went on just as usual was i the same when i got up this \
morning but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah \
that s the great puzzle as she said this she looked down at her hands and was \
surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid \
gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be \
growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it \
and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking \
rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding \
and she dropped it hastily just in time to save herself from shrinking away \
altogether that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the \
sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for \
the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the \
little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass \
table as before things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never \
was so small as this before never as she said these words her foot slipped \
and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first \
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea however she soon made out \
that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet \
high just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way \
off and she swam nearer to see what it was she soon made out that it was only \
a mouse that had slipped in like herself would it be of any use now thought \
alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here that i \
should think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in trying so \
she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of \
swimming about here o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and \
seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing perhaps \
it doesn t understand english thought alice i dare say it s a french mouse \
come over with william the conqueror so she began again o\[ATilde] est ma \
chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson book the mouse gave \
a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i \
beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal \
s feelings i quite forgot you didn t like cats not like cats cried the mouse \
in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me well perhaps \
not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it and yet i wish i \
could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could \
only see her she is such a dear quiet thing the mouse was bristling all over \
and she felt certain it must be really offended we won t talk about her any \
more if you d rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to \
the end of its tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always \
hated cats nasty low vulgar things don t let me hear the name again i won t \
indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are \
you are you fond of of dogs there is such a nice little dog near our house i \
should like to show you it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a \
sorrowful tone i m afraid i ve offended it again for the mouse was swimming \
away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool \
as it went so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we \
won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them when the mouse \
heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite \
pale and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i \
ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs \
it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds \
and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and \
an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole \
party swam to the shore iii a caucus race and a long tale they were indeed a \
queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled \
feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping \
wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course was how to get dry \
again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed \
quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she \
had known them all her life at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of \
some authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me i \
ll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with \
the mouse in the middle ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all \
ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william \
the conqueror whose cause was favored by the pope was soon submitted to by \
the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to \
usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria \
ugh said the lory with a shiver and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of \
canterbury found it advisable found what said the duck found it the mouse \
replied rather crossly of course you know what it means i know what it means \
well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a worm \
the question is what did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this \
question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling \
to meet william and offer him the crown how are you getting on now my dear it \
continued turning to alice as it spoke as wet as ever said alice in a \
melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all in that case said the dodo \
solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate \
adoption of more energetic remedies speak english said the eaglet i don t \
know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you \
do either what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone is that \
the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race what is a caucus race \
said alice why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it first it \
marked out a race course in a sort of circle and then all the party were \
placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away \
but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that \
it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called \
out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who \
has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of \
thought at last it said everybody has won and all must have prizes but who is \
to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked why she of course said the \
dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded \
round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes alice had no idea what \
to do and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of \
comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as \
prizes there was exactly one a piece all round the next thing was to eat the \
comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained \
that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be \
patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a \
ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more you promised to tell me \
your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in \
a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again mine is a long and a \
sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing it is a long tail \
certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail but why do \
you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was \
speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a \
mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you \
come i ll take no denial we must have the trial for really this morning i ve \
nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or \
judge would be wasting our breath i ll be judge i ll be jury said cunning old \
fury i ll try the whole cause and condemn you to death you are not attending \
said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of i beg your pardon \
said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think you insult me by \
talking such nonsense said the mouse getting up and walking away please come \
back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in \
chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker i wish i had dinah our cat here said alice this caused a \
remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once \
and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my \
dears it s high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved \
off and alice was soon left alone i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah nobody \
seems to like her down here and i m sure she s the best cat in the world poor \
alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited in a \
little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the \
distance and she looked up eagerly iv the rabbit sends in a little bill it \
was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about \
as it went as if it had lost something alice heard it muttering to itself the \
duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she ll get me \
executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i \
wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair \
of white kid gloves and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them \
but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her \
swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door \
had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice and called to her \
in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now he took me for his \
housemaid said alice as she ran off how surprised he ll be when he finds out \
who i am as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of \
which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she \
went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should \
meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found \
the fan and gloves by this time alice had found her way into a tidy little \
room with a table in the window and on it a fan and two or three pairs of \
tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was \
just going to leave the room when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that \
stood near the looking glass she uncorked it and put it to her lips saying to \
herself i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired \
of being such a tiny little thing before she had drunk half the bottle she \
found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck \
from being broken she hastily put down the bottle remarking that s quite \
enough i hope i sha n t grow any more alas it was too late to wish that she \
went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor \
still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the \
window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more \
whatever happens what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic \
bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger after a few minutes \
she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen mary ann mary ann said the \
voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on \
the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she \
trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a \
thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it \
presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door \
opened inwards and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt \
proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then i ll go round and get in \
at the window that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she fancied \
she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand \
and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a \
little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded \
that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of \
that sort next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat pat where are you and \
then a voice she had never heard before sure then i m here digging for apples \
yer honor here come and help me out of this now tell me pat what s that in \
the window sure it s an arm yer honor well it s got no business there at any \
rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could \
only hear whispers now and then and at last she spread out her hand again and \
made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and \
more sounds of broken glass i wonder what they ll do next thought alice as \
for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could she waited for some \
time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cart \
wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out \
the words where s the other ladder bill s got the other bill here bill will \
the roof bear who s to go down the chimney nay i sha n t you do it here bill \
the master says you ve got to go down the chimney alice drew her foot as far \
down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal \
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then she gave \
one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next the first thing she \
heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit s voice alone \
catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices \
hold up his head brandy now don t choke him what happened to you last came a \
little feeble squeaking voice well i hardly know no more thank ye i m better \
now all i know is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes \
like a sky rocket after a minute or two of silence they began moving about \
again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with a \
barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next \
moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of \
them hit her in the face alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles \
were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea \
came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make \
some change in my size so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to \
find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get \
through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little \
animals and birds waiting outside they all made a rush at alice the moment \
she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe \
in a thick wood the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she \
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second \
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i suppose i ought to eat or \
drink something or other but the great question is what alice looked all \
around her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she could not see \
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same \
height as herself she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge \
and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was \
sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else v advice from a \
caterpillar at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed alice in a languid sleepy voice who are you said the caterpillar \
alice replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present at least i \
know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have changed \
several times since then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar \
sternly explain yourself i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice \
because i m not myself you see being so many different sizes in a day is very \
confusing she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell \
me who you are first why said the caterpillar as alice could not think of any \
good reason and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of \
mind she turned away come back the caterpillar called after her i ve \
something important to say alice turned and came back again keep your temper \
said the caterpillar is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well \
as she could no said the caterpillar it unfolded its arms took the hookah out \
of its mouth again and said so you think you re changed do you i m afraid i \
am sir said alice i can t remember things as i used and i don t keep the same \
size for ten minutes together what size do you want to be asked the \
caterpillar oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one \
doesn t like changing so often you know i should like to be a little larger \
sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to \
be it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing \
itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high in a minute or \
two the caterpillar got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass \
merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other \
side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side of what \
thought alice to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she \
had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained \
looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which \
were the two sides of it at last she stretched her arms round it as far as \
they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is \
which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try \
the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had \
struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change as \
she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other \
bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly \
room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel \
of the left hand bit come my head s free at last said alice but all she could \
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise \
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her where have \
my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i can t see you she was \
delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like \
a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag \
and was going to dive in among the leaves when a sharp hiss made her draw \
back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her \
violently with its wings serpent cried the pigeon i m not a serpent said \
alice indignantly let me alone i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried \
banks and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on but those serpents there s no \
pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled as if it wasn t trouble enough \
hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents \
night and day and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continued \
the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should \
be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh \
serpent but i m not a serpent i tell you said alice i m a i m a i m a little \
girl she added rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she \
had gone through that day you re looking for eggs i know that well enough \
said the pigeon and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or \
a serpent it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m not looking \
for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn t want yours i don t like them \
raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again \
into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for \
her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she \
had to stop and untwist it after awhile she remembered that she still held \
the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully \
nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and \
sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her \
usual height it was so long since she had been anything near the right size \
that it felt quite strange at first the next thing is to get into that \
beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came \
suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high \
whoever lives there thought alice it ll never do to come upon them this size \
why i should frighten them out of their wits she did not venture to go near \
the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high vi pig and \
pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood judging by his face only she \
would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles \
it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes \
like a frog the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great \
letter and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the \
duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman \
repeated in the same solemn tone from the queen an invitation for the duchess \
to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled \
together when alice next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other \
was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky \
alice went timidly up to the door and knocked there s no sort of use in \
knocking said the footman and that for two reasons first because i m on the \
same side of the door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise \
inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most \
extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every \
now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces \
how am i to get in asked alice are you to get in at all said the footman that \
s the first question you know alice opened the door and went in the door led \
right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other \
the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby \
the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large caldron which seemed to \
be full of soup there s certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to \
herself as well as she could for sneezing even the duchess sneezed \
occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately \
without a moment s pause the only two creatures in the kitchen that did not \
sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was grinning from ear to ear \
please would you tell me said alice a little timidly why your cat grins like \
that it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why i didn t know that \
cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didn t know that cats could grin said \
alice you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came \
first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took \
no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much \
already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not \
oh please mind what you re doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony \
of terror here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice \
flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet \
with the queen and she hurried out of the room alice caught the baby with \
some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its \
arms and legs in all directions if i don t take this child away with me \
thought alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder \
to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing \
grunted in reply if you re going to turn into a pig my dear said alice i ll \
have nothing more to do with you mind now alice was just beginning to think \
to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it \
grunted again so violently that alice looked down into its face in some alarm \
this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less \
than a pig so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see \
it trot away quietly into the wood alice was a little startled by seeing the \
cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only \
grinned when it saw her cheshire puss began alice rather timidly would you \
please tell me which way i ought to go from here in that direction the cat \
said waving the right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving \
the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like they re both mad but i \
don t want to go among mad people alice remarked oh you can t help that said \
the cat we re all mad here do you play croquet with the queen to day i should \
like it very much said alice but i haven t been invited yet you ll see me \
there said the cat and vanished alice had not gone much farther before she \
came in sight of the house of the march hare it was so large a house that she \
did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the left hand bit \
of mushroom vii a mad tea party there was a table set out under a tree in \
front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a \
dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep the table was a large one but \
the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they \
cried out when they saw alice coming there s plenty of room said alice \
indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table the \
hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a \
raven like a writing desk i m glad they ve begun asking riddles i believe i \
can guess that she added aloud do you mean that you think you can find out \
the answer to it said the march hare exactly so said alice then you should \
say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hastily replied at least \
at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know you might just as \
well say added the dormouse which seemed to be talking in its sleep that i \
breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe it is the \
same thing with you said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its \
nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its \
eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself have you \
guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again no i give it up \
alice replied what s the answer i haven t the slightest idea said the hatter \
nor i said the march hare alice gave a weary sigh i think you might do \
something better with the time she said than wasting it in asking riddles \
that have no answers take some more tea the march hare said to alice very \
earnestly i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can t \
take more you mean you can t take less said the hatter it s very easy to take \
more than nothing at this alice got up and walked off the dormouse fell \
asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going \
though she looked back once or twice the last time she saw them they were \
trying to put the dormouse into the tea pot at any rate i ll never go there \
again said alice as she picked her way through the wood it s the stupidest \
tea party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that \
one of the trees had a door leading right into it that s very curious she \
thought i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she \
found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table taking the \
little golden key she unlocked the door that led into the garden then she set \
to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket \
till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and \
then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright \
flower beds and the cool fountains viii the queen s croquet ground a large \
rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were \
white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red suddenly \
their eyes chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them would you \
tell me please said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses \
five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why \
the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we \
put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should \
all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss we re doing our best \
afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across \
the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly \
threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps \
and alice looked round eager to see the queen first came ten soldiers \
carrying clubs with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten \
courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds after these came the \
royal children there were ten of them all ornamented with hearts next came \
the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognized the white \
rabbit then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king s crown on a \
crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king \
and the queen of hearts when the procession came opposite to alice they all \
stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it \
to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply my name is alice so \
please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why \
they re only a pack of cards after all can you play croquet shouted the queen \
the question was evidently meant for alice yes said alice loudly come on then \
roared the queen it s it s a very fine day said a timid voice to alice she \
was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face very \
said alice where s the duchess hush hush said the rabbit she s under sentence \
of execution what for said alice she boxed the queen s ears the rabbit began \
get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began \
running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they \
got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had \
never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and \
furrows the croquet balls were live hedgehogs and the mallets live flamingos \
and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and \
feet to make the arches the players all played at once without waiting for \
turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very \
short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and \
shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute they \
re dreadfully fond of beheading people here thought alice the great wonder is \
that there s anyone left alive she was looking about for some way of escape \
when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it s the cheshire cat she \
said to herself now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on \
said the cat i don t think they play at all fairly alice said in a rather \
complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself \
speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular how do you like the \
queen said the cat in a low voice not at all said alice alice thought she \
might as well go back and see how the game was going on so she went off in \
search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another \
hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of \
them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across \
to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless \
sort of way to fly up into a tree she caught the flamingo and tucked it away \
under her arm that it might not escape again just then alice ran across the \
duchess who was now out of prison she tucked her arm affectionately into \
alice s and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper she was a little startled however when she heard the voice \
of the duchess close to her ear you re thinking about something my dear and \
that makes you forget to talk the game s going on rather better now alice \
said by way of keeping up the conversation a little tis so said the duchess \
and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round \
somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding his own \
business ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her \
sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is \
take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves to alice s \
great surprise the duchess s arm that was linked into hers began to tremble \
alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms \
folded frowning like a thunderstorm now i give you fair warning shouted the \
queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off \
and that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice \
and was gone in a moment let s go on with the game the queen said to alice \
and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back \
to the croquet ground all the time they were playing the queen never left off \
quarreling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with \
her head by the end of half an hour or so all the players except the king the \
queen and alice were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of \
execution then the queen left off quite out of breath and walked away with \
alice alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you \
are all pardoned suddenly the cry the trial s beginning was heard in the \
distance and alice ran along with the others ix who stole the tarts the king \
and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a \
great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well \
as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with \
a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit \
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very \
middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it i wish \
they d get the trial done alice thought and hand round the refreshments the \
judge by the way was the king and he wore his crown over his great wig that s \
the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures some were animals and \
some were birds i suppose they are the jurors just then the white rabbit \
cried out silence in the court herald read the accusation said the king on \
this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet then unrolled the \
parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts \
all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them \
quite away call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew \
three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness the first witness \
was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and \
butter in the other you ought to have finished said the king when did you \
begin the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court \
arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it was he said give \
your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on \
the spot this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting \
from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion \
he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter just \
at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation she was beginning to grow \
larger again the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and \
went down on one knee i m a poor man your majesty he began you re a very poor \
speaker said the king you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left \
the court call the next witness said the king the next witness was the \
duchess s cook she carried the pepper box in her hand and the people near the \
door began sneezing all at once give your evidence said the king sha n t said \
the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low \
voice your majesty must cross examine this witness well if i must i must the \
king said what are tarts made of pepper mostly said the cook for some minutes \
the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled down again \
the cook had disappeared never mind said the king call the next witness alice \
watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list imagine her surprise \
when he read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice x alice \
s evidence here cried alice she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury box upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay the trial \
cannot proceed said the king until all the jurymen are back in their proper \
places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice what do you \
know about this business the king said to alice nothing whatever said alice \
the king then read from his book rule forty two all persons more than a mile \
high to leave the court i m not a mile high said alice nearly two miles high \
said the queen well i sha n t go at any rate said alice the king turned pale \
and shut his note book hastily consider your verdict he said to the jury in a \
low trembling voice there s more evidence to come yet please your majesty \
said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been \
picked up it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody he \
unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a \
set of verses please your majesty said the knave i didn t write it and they \
can t prove that i did there s no name signed at the end you must have meant \
some mischief or else you d have signed your name like an honest man said the \
king there was a general clapping of hands at this read them he added turning \
to the white rabbit there was dead silence in the court whilst the white \
rabbit read out the verses that s the most important piece of evidence we ve \
heard yet said the king i don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it \
ventured alice if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a world \
of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any let the jury consider their \
verdict no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards stuff and \
nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence first hold your \
tongue said the queen turning purple i won t said alice off with her head the \
queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody moved who cares for you said \
alice she had grown to her full size by this time you re nothing but a pack \
of cards at this the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon \
her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to \
beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of \
her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered \
down from the trees upon her face wake up alice dear said her sister why what \
a long sleep you ve had oh i ve had such a curious dream said alice and she \
told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange \
adventures of hers that you have just been reading about alice got up and ran \
off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had \

       "I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE Alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures \
or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \
\"without pictures or conversations?\" So she was considering in her own mind \
(as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of \
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink \
eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did \
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took \
a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out \
of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was \
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In \
another moment, down went Alice after it! The rabbit-hole went straight on \
like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that \
Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found \
herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Either the well was \
very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went \
down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, \
but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well \
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and \
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one \
of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to \
her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so \
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Down, down, \
down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so \
Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I \
should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of \
milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\" Alice \
felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon \
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit \
hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark \
overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still \
in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went \
Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a \
corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close \
behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be \
seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of \
lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but they \
were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the \
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she \
was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of \
solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first \
idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! \
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, \
it would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came \
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little \
door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, \
and to her great delight, it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it \
led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and \
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she \
longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of \
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a \
telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\" Alice went back to \
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a \
book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a \
little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said Alice), \
and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \
\"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. \"No, I'll look \
first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not,\" for she \
had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is \
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle \
was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it \
very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, \
roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off. * \
* * * * \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like \
a telescope!\" And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and \
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \
going through the little door into that lovely garden. After awhile, finding \
that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; \
but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had \
forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, \
she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with \
trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \"Come, there's no use in \
crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather sharply. \"I advise you to \
leave off this minute!\" She generally gave herself very good advice (though \
she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely \
as to bring tears into her eyes. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that \
was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, \
on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, \
I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the \
key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either \
way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\" She ate a \
little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which way?\" holding \
her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she \
was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to \
work and very soon finished off the cake. II--THE POOL OF TEARS \"Curiouser \
and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment \
she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I'm opening out like the \
largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I \
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\" Just at this \
moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now \
rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden \
key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she \
could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one \
eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began \
to cry again. She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large \
pool all 'round her and reaching half down the hall. After a time, she heard \
a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to \
see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, \
with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He \
came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the \
Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\" \
When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you \
please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves \
and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice \
took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went \
on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday \
things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got up this morning? \
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, \
_that's_ the great puzzle!\" As she said this, she looked down at her hands \
and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white \
kid-gloves while she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she \
thought. \"I must be growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table \
to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and \
was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was \
the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save \
herself from shrinking away altogether. \"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said \
Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find \
herself still in existence. \"And now for the garden!\" And she ran with all \
speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and \
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \"Things are \
worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this \
before, never!\" As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another \
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that \
she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was \
in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. Just \
then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and \
she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a \
mouse that had slipped in like herself. \"Would it be of any use, now,\" \
thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down \
here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no \
harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this \
pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at \
her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little \
eyes, but it said nothing. \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought \
Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the \
Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"O\[CapitalATilde]\.b9 est ma chatte?\" \
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a \
sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, \
I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor \
animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\" \"Not like \
cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like \
cats, if you were me?\" \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \
\"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I \
think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a \
dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it \
must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather \
not.\" \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of \
its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ \
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\" \"I \
won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of \
conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice \
little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats \
and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended \
it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, \
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly \
after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or \
dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned \
'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in \
a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my \
history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\" It was high \
time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals \
that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, \
and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party \
swam to the shore. III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE They were indeed a \
queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled \
feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping \
wet, cross and uncomfortable. The first question, of course, was how to get \
dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it \
seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, \
as if she had known them all her life. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a \
person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and \
listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, \
in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with \
an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. \
Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was \
favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted \
leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. \
Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\" \"Ugh!\" said the \
Lory, with a shiver. \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of \
Canterbury, found it advisable'--\" \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck. \"Found \
_it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' \
means.\" \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said \
the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the \
archbishop find?\" The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went \
on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and \
offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, \
turning to Alice as it spoke. \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy \
tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\" \"In that case,\" said the Dodo \
solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the \
immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\" \"Speak English!\" said the \
Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's \
more, I don't believe you do either!\" \"What I was going to say,\" said the \
Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a \
Caucus-race.\" \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice. \"Why,\" said the \
Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a \
race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along \
the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but \
they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it \
was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called \
out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and \
asking, \"But who has won?\" This question the Dodo could not answer without \
a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ \
must have prizes.\" \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of \
voices asked. \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice \
with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, \
in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\" Alice had no idea what to do, and in \
despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits \
(luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as \
prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round. The next thing was to eat \
the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds \
complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and \
had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down \
again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. \"You \
promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you \
hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be \
offended again. \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to \
Alice and sighing. \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking \
down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she \
kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of \
the tale was something like this:-- \"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in \
the house, 'Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-- Come, I'll \
take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing \
to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or \
judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said \
cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\" \
\"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you \
thinking of?\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got \
to the fifth bend, I think?\" \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" \
said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \"Please come back and finish \
your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \
\"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker. \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This \
caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off \
at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \
\"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various \
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone. \"I wish I hadn't \
mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the \
best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very \
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little \
pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly. IV--THE \
RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back \
again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; \
Alice heard it muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear \
paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are \
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a \
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and \
she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere \
to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and \
the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished \
completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an \
angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\" \"He took me \
for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be \
when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little \
house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. \
RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, \
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the \
house before she had found the fan and gloves. By this time, Alice had found \
her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan \
and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a \
pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell \
upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and \
put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large \
again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\" \
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the \
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put \
down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any \
more.\" Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing \
and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, \
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up \
the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. \
What _will_ become of me?\" Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had \
now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard \
a voice outside and stopped to listen. \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the \
voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Then came a little pattering of \
feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and \
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now \
about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid \
of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as \
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that \
attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll go 'round \
and get in at the window.\" \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after \
waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she \
suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get \
hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of \
broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had \
fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort. Next came an angry \
voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And then a voice she had \
never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\" \
\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the \
window?\" \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\" \"Well, it's got no business \
there, at any rate; go and take it away!\" There was a long silence after \
this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread \
out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were \
_two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll \
do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish \
they _could_!\" She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At \
last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many \
voices all talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other \
ladder? Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to \
go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master \
says you've got to go down the chimney!\" Alice drew her foot as far down the \
chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and \
scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick \
and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a \
general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch \
him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence and then another confusion of \
voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--What happened to \
you?\" Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No \
more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me like a \
Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" After a minute or two of \
silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A \
barrowful will do, to begin with.\" \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. \
But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles \
came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice \
noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little \
cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I \
eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in \
my size.\" So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that \
she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through \
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals \
and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she \
appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in \
a thick wood. \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as \
she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the \
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to \
eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'\" Alice \
looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could \
not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same \
height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the \
edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was \
sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. V--ADVICE FROM A \
CATERPILLAR At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice. \"Who are _you_?\" said the \
Caterpillar. Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at \
present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think \
I must have changed several times since then.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \
said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain yourself!\" \"I can't explain \
_myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm not myself, you \
see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\" She drew \
herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you ought to tell me who _you_ \
are, first.\" \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar. As Alice could not think of any \
good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of \
mind, she turned away. \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \
\"I've something important to say!\" Alice turned and came back again. \"Keep \
your temper,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing \
down her anger as well as she could. \"No,\" said the Caterpillar. It \
unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you \
think you're changed, do you?\" \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I \
can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten \
minutes together!\" \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar. \
\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one \
doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_ \
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a \
wretched height to be.\" \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the \
Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three \
inches high). In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom \
and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side \
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\" \
\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to herself. \
\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; \
and in another moment, it was out of sight. Alice remained looking \
thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the \
two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they \
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. \"And now which is \
which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to \
try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her \
chin--it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very \
sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to \
eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot \
that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and \
managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.... \"Come, my head's free \
at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an \
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of \
green leaves that lay far below her. \"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And \
oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\" She was delighted to find \
that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She \
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to \
dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a \
large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its \
wings. \"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon. \"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice \
indignantly. \"Let me alone!\" \"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've \
tried banks, and I've tried hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those \
serpents! There's no pleasing them!\" Alice was more and more puzzled. \"As \
if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon, \"but I \
must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken \
the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a \
shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they \
must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\" \"But I'm _not_ \
a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a little girl,\" she \
added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone \
through that day. \"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" \
said the Pigeon; \"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl \
or a serpent?\" \"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but \
I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want \
_yours_--I don't like them raw.\" \"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in \
a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down \
among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled \
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. \
After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her \
hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at \
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had \
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since \
she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at \
first. \"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that \
to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open \
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\
\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size; why, I \
should frighten them out of their wits!\" She did not venture to go near the \
house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. VI--PIG AND \
PEPPER For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she \
would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his \
knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and \
large eyes like a frog. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his \
arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn \
tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The \
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An \
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low and \
their curls got entangled together. When Alice next peeped out, the \
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, \
staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door and \
knocked. \"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that \
for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; \
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly \
hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on \
within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great \
crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \"How am I to get \
in?\" asked Alice. \"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's \
the first question, you know.\" Alice opened the door and went in. The door \
led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the \
other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing \
a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which \
seemed to be full of soup. \"There's certainly too much pepper in that \
soup!\" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. Even the \
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and \
howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the \
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was \
grinning from ear to ear. \"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why your cat grins like that?\" \"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the \
Duchess, \"and that's why.\" \"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always \
grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice. \"You \
don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\" Just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came \
first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess \
took no notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so \
much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or \
not. \"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and \
down in an agony of terror. \"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" \
the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go \
and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the \
room. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped \
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I \
don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to kill \
it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She said the \
last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply. \"If you're going \
to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have nothing more to do \
with you. Mind now!\" Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, \
what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted \
again so violently that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This \
time there could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than \
a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it \
trot away quietly into the wood. Alice was a little startled by seeing the \
Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only \
grinned when it saw her. \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \
\"would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?\" \"In _that_ \
direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives a Hatter; and \
in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit \
either you like; they're both mad.\" \"But I don't want to go among mad \
people,\" Alice remarked. \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're \
all mad here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\" \"I should like it \
very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited yet.\" \"You'll see me \
there,\" said the Cat, and vanished. Alice had not gone much farther before \
she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; it was so large a house \
that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the \
left-hand bit of mushroom. VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY There was a table set out \
under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were \
having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep. The table \
was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. \
\"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \"There's \
_plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large \
arm-chair at one end of the table. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on \
hearing this, but all he said was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\" \
\"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she \
added aloud. \"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to \
it?\" said the March Hare. \"Exactly so,\" said Alice. \"Then you should say \
what you mean,\" the March Hare went on. \"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \
\"at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.\" \
\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be \
talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I \
sleep when I breathe!'\" \"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the \
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its \
head impatiently and said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; \
just what I was going to remark myself.\" \"Have you guessed the riddle \
yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \"No, I give it up,\" Alice \
replied. \"What's the answer?\" \"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the \
Hatter. \"Nor I,\" said the March Hare. Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think \
you might do something better with the time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in \
asking riddles that have no answers.\" \"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare \
said to Alice, very earnestly. \"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an \
offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\" \"You mean you can't take _less_,\" \
said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\" At this, \
Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither \
of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once \
or twice; the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse \
into the tea-pot. \"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, \
as she picked her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever \
was at in all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the \
trees had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \
\"I think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went. Once more she found \
herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. Taking the \
little golden key, she unlocked the door that led into the garden. Then she \
set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her \
pocket) till she was about a foot high; then she walked down the little \
passage; and _then_--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among \
the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET \
GROUND A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses \
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily \
painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as she \
stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\" Five and Seven said nothing, \
but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, \
Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one \
in by mistake; and, if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our \
heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she \
comes, to--\" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the \
garden, called out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners \
instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many \
footsteps and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten \
soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the \
ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came \
the royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next \
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the \
White Rabbit. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on \
a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING \
AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all \
stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She \
said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \"My name \
is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely; but she added \
to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!\" \"Can you play \
croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for Alice. \
\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly. \"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen. \"It's--it's \
a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by the White \
Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \"Very,\" said Alice. \
\"Where's the Duchess?\" \"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under \
sentence of execution.\" \"What for?\" said Alice. \"She boxed the Queen's \
ears--\" the Rabbit began. \"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a \
voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling \
up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and \
the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious \
croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls \
were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to \
double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. \
The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all \
the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen \
was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, \"Off with his \
head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute. \"They're \
dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the great wonder \
is that there's anyone left alive!\" She was looking about for some way of \
escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. \"It's the \
Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself; \"now I shall have somebody to talk \
to.\" \"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat. \"I don't think they play at \
all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; \"and they all \
quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to \
have any rules in particular.\" \"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat \
in a low voice. \"Not at all,\" said Alice. Alice thought she might as well \
go back and see how the game was going on. So she went off in search of her \
hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which \
seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the \
other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other \
side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of \
way, to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under \
her arm, that it might not escape again. Just then Alice ran across the \
Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her arm affectionately into \
Alice's and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper. She was a little startled, however, when she heard the \
voice of the Duchess close to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my \
dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\" \"The game's going on rather \
better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. \
\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love, \
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'\" \"Somebody said,\" Alice \
whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding his own business!\" \"Ah, \
well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her sharp \
little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of _that_ \
is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.'\" \
To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers began \
to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them, with \
her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm! \"Now, I give you fair \
warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke, \"either \
you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your \
choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \"Let's go \
on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much \
frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. \
All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with the \
other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" \
By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the King, the Queen \
and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution. \
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with Alice. \
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You are \
all pardoned.\" Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the \
distance, and Alice ran along with the others. IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS? The \
King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with \
a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as \
well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in \
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the \
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the \
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of \
tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" Alice thought, \"and \
hand 'round the refreshments!\" The judge, by the way, was the King and he \
wore his crown over his great wig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \
\"and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I \
suppose they are the jurors.\" Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence \
in the court!\" \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King. On this, the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the \
parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some \
tarts, All on a summer day; The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And \
took them quite away!\" \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First \
witness!\" The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one \
hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. \"You ought to have \
finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\" The Hatter looked at the \
March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the \
Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\" he said. \"Give your \
evidence,\" said the King, \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed \
on the spot.\" This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept \
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in \
his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread \
and butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was \
beginning to grow larger again. The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and \
bread and butter and went down on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" \
he began. \"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King. \"You may go,\" \
said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court. \"Call the next \
witness!\" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She \
carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began \
sneezing all at once. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King. \"Sha'n't,\" \
said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a \
low voice, \"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\" \"Well, if I \
must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\" \"Pepper, \
mostly,\" said the cook. For some minutes the whole court was in confusion \
and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \
\"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\" Alice watched the \
White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read \
out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"Alice!\" X--ALICE'S \
EVIDENCE \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below. \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay. \
\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are back \
in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking \
hard at Alice. \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to \
Alice. \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice. The King then read from his book: \
\"Rule forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\" \
\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice. \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the \
Queen. \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice. The King turned pale \
and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your verdict,\" he said to the \
jury, in a low, trembling voice. \"There's more evidence to come yet, please \
Your Majesty,\" said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This \
paper has just been picked up. It seems to be a letter written by the \
prisoner to--to somebody.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It \
isn't a letter, after all; it's a set of verses.\" \"Please, Your Majesty,\" \
said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; there's \
no name signed at the end.\" \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else \
you'd have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a \
general clapping of hands at this. \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the \
White Rabbit. There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit \
read out the verses. \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've \
heard yet,\" said the King. \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in \
it,\" ventured Alice. \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that \
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the \
jury consider their verdict.\" \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence \
first--verdict afterwards.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The \
idea of having the sentence first!\" \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, \
turning purple. \"I won't!\" said Alice. \"Off with her head!\" the Queen \
shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \"Who cares for _you_?\" said \
Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). \"You're nothing but a \
pack of cards!\" At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying \
down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, \
and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her \
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves \
that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \"Wake up, Alice \
dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've had!\" \"Oh, I've \
had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as \
she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have \
just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as \
well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.", $CellContext`textProc = 
       "i down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or \
conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without \
pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as \
she could for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the \
pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and \
picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by \
her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so \
very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i \
shall be too late but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its \
waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her \
feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit \
with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with \
curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it \
pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went \
alice after it the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way \
and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to \
think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what \
seemed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very \
slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her first \
she tried to make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see \
anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were \
filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and \
pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she \
passed it was labeled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was \
empty she did not like to drop the jar so managed to put it into one of the \
cupboards as she fell past it down down down would the fall never come to an \
end there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking to herself dinah \
ll miss me very much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope they ll \
remember her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down \
here with me alice felt that she was dozing off when suddenly thump thump \
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over \
alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up in a moment she looked up but it \
was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white \
rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost \
away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it \
turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting she was close \
behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen \
she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps \
hanging from the roof there were doors all round the hall but they were all \
locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other \
trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever \
to get out again suddenly she came upon a little table all made of solid \
glass there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alice s first idea \
was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either \
the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would \
not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low \
curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about \
fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her \
great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a \
small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along \
the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out \
of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and \
those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway \
oh said alice how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if \
i only knew how to begin alice went back to the table half hoping she might \
find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up \
like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was \
not here before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper \
label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters no i \
ll look first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not for she had \
never forgotten that if you drink from a bottle marked poison it is almost \
certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not \
marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had a \
sort of mixed flavor of cherry tart custard pineapple roast turkey toffy and \
hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off what a curious feeling said \
alice i must be shutting up like a telescope and so it was indeed she was now \
only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was \
now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden \
after awhile finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the \
garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she \
had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for \
it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying \
the poor little thing sat down and cried come there s no use in crying like \
that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this \
minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom \
followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears \
into her eyes soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under \
the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words \
eat me were beautifully marked in currants well i ll eat it said alice and if \
it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i \
can creep under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i don t \
care which happens she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which \
way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she \
was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same \
size so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake ii the pool of \
tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for \
the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now i m opening out \
like the largest telescope that ever was good by feet oh my poor little feet \
i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears i shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you just at this moment \
her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now rather more \
than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried \
off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down \
on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through \
was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again she went on \
shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her and \
reaching half down the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet \
in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was \
the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves \
in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great \
hurry muttering to himself oh the duchess the duchess oh won t she be savage \
if i ve kept her waiting when the rabbit came near her alice began in a low \
timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white \
kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he \
could go alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all \
the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day and \
yesterday things went on just as usual was i the same when i got up this \
morning but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah \
that s the great puzzle as she said this she looked down at her hands and was \
surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid \
gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be \
growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it \
and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking \
rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding \
and she dropped it hastily just in time to save herself from shrinking away \
altogether that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the \
sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for \
the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the \
little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass \
table as before things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never \
was so small as this before never as she said these words her foot slipped \
and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first \
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea however she soon made out \
that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet \
high just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way \
off and she swam nearer to see what it was she soon made out that it was only \
a mouse that had slipped in like herself would it be of any use now thought \
alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here that i \
should think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in trying so \
she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of \
swimming about here o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and \
seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing perhaps \
it doesn t understand english thought alice i dare say it s a french mouse \
come over with william the conqueror so she began again o\[ATilde] est ma \
chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson book the mouse gave \
a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i \
beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal \
s feelings i quite forgot you didn t like cats not like cats cried the mouse \
in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me well perhaps \
not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it and yet i wish i \
could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could \
only see her she is such a dear quiet thing the mouse was bristling all over \
and she felt certain it must be really offended we won t talk about her any \
more if you d rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to \
the end of its tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always \
hated cats nasty low vulgar things don t let me hear the name again i won t \
indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are \
you are you fond of of dogs there is such a nice little dog near our house i \
should like to show you it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a \
sorrowful tone i m afraid i ve offended it again for the mouse was swimming \
away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool \
as it went so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we \
won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them when the mouse \
heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite \
pale and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i \
ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs \
it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds \
and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and \
an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole \
party swam to the shore iii a caucus race and a long tale they were indeed a \
queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled \
feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping \
wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course was how to get dry \
again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed \
quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she \
had known them all her life at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of \
some authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me i \
ll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with \
the mouse in the middle ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all \
ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william \
the conqueror whose cause was favored by the pope was soon submitted to by \
the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to \
usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria \
ugh said the lory with a shiver and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of \
canterbury found it advisable found what said the duck found it the mouse \
replied rather crossly of course you know what it means i know what it means \
well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a worm \
the question is what did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this \
question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling \
to meet william and offer him the crown how are you getting on now my dear it \
continued turning to alice as it spoke as wet as ever said alice in a \
melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all in that case said the dodo \
solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate \
adoption of more energetic remedies speak english said the eaglet i don t \
know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you \
do either what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone is that \
the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race what is a caucus race \
said alice why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it first it \
marked out a race course in a sort of circle and then all the party were \
placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away \
but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that \
it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called \
out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who \
has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of \
thought at last it said everybody has won and all must have prizes but who is \
to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked why she of course said the \
dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded \
round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes alice had no idea what \
to do and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of \
comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as \
prizes there was exactly one a piece all round the next thing was to eat the \
comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained \
that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be \
patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a \
ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more you promised to tell me \
your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in \
a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again mine is a long and a \
sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing it is a long tail \
certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail but why do \
you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was \
speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a \
mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you \
come i ll take no denial we must have the trial for really this morning i ve \
nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or \
judge would be wasting our breath i ll be judge i ll be jury said cunning old \
fury i ll try the whole cause and condemn you to death you are not attending \
said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of i beg your pardon \
said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think you insult me by \
talking such nonsense said the mouse getting up and walking away please come \
back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in \
chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker i wish i had dinah our cat here said alice this caused a \
remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once \
and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my \
dears it s high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved \
off and alice was soon left alone i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah nobody \
seems to like her down here and i m sure she s the best cat in the world poor \
alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited in a \
little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the \
distance and she looked up eagerly iv the rabbit sends in a little bill it \
was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about \
as it went as if it had lost something alice heard it muttering to itself the \
duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she ll get me \
executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i \
wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair \
of white kid gloves and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them \
but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her \
swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door \
had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice and called to her \
in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now he took me for his \
housemaid said alice as she ran off how surprised he ll be when he finds out \
who i am as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of \
which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she \
went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should \
meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found \
the fan and gloves by this time alice had found her way into a tidy little \
room with a table in the window and on it a fan and two or three pairs of \
tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was \
just going to leave the room when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that \
stood near the looking glass she uncorked it and put it to her lips saying to \
herself i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired \
of being such a tiny little thing before she had drunk half the bottle she \
found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck \
from being broken she hastily put down the bottle remarking that s quite \
enough i hope i sha n t grow any more alas it was too late to wish that she \
went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor \
still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the \
window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more \
whatever happens what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic \
bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger after a few minutes \
she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen mary ann mary ann said the \
voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on \
the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she \
trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a \
thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it \
presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door \
opened inwards and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt \
proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then i ll go round and get in \
at the window that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she fancied \
she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand \
and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a \
little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded \
that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of \
that sort next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat pat where are you and \
then a voice she had never heard before sure then i m here digging for apples \
yer honor here come and help me out of this now tell me pat what s that in \
the window sure it s an arm yer honor well it s got no business there at any \
rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could \
only hear whispers now and then and at last she spread out her hand again and \
made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and \
more sounds of broken glass i wonder what they ll do next thought alice as \
for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could she waited for some \
time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cart \
wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out \
the words where s the other ladder bill s got the other bill here bill will \
the roof bear who s to go down the chimney nay i sha n t you do it here bill \
the master says you ve got to go down the chimney alice drew her foot as far \
down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal \
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then she gave \
one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next the first thing she \
heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit s voice alone \
catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices \
hold up his head brandy now don t choke him what happened to you last came a \
little feeble squeaking voice well i hardly know no more thank ye i m better \
now all i know is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes \
like a sky rocket after a minute or two of silence they began moving about \
again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with a \
barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next \
moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of \
them hit her in the face alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles \
were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea \
came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make \
some change in my size so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to \
find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get \
through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little \
animals and birds waiting outside they all made a rush at alice the moment \
she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe \
in a thick wood the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she \
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second \
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i suppose i ought to eat or \
drink something or other but the great question is what alice looked all \
around her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she could not see \
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same \
height as herself she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge \
and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was \
sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else v advice from a \
caterpillar at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed alice in a languid sleepy voice who are you said the caterpillar \
alice replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present at least i \
know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have changed \
several times since then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar \
sternly explain yourself i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice \
because i m not myself you see being so many different sizes in a day is very \
confusing she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell \
me who you are first why said the caterpillar as alice could not think of any \
good reason and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of \
mind she turned away come back the caterpillar called after her i ve \
something important to say alice turned and came back again keep your temper \
said the caterpillar is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well \
as she could no said the caterpillar it unfolded its arms took the hookah out \
of its mouth again and said so you think you re changed do you i m afraid i \
am sir said alice i can t remember things as i used and i don t keep the same \
size for ten minutes together what size do you want to be asked the \
caterpillar oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one \
doesn t like changing so often you know i should like to be a little larger \
sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to \
be it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing \
itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high in a minute or \
two the caterpillar got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass \
merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other \
side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side of what \
thought alice to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she \
had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained \
looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which \
were the two sides of it at last she stretched her arms round it as far as \
they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is \
which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try \
the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had \
struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change as \
she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other \
bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly \
room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel \
of the left hand bit come my head s free at last said alice but all she could \
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise \
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her where have \
my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i can t see you she was \
delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like \
a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag \
and was going to dive in among the leaves when a sharp hiss made her draw \
back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her \
violently with its wings serpent cried the pigeon i m not a serpent said \
alice indignantly let me alone i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried \
banks and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on but those serpents there s no \
pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled as if it wasn t trouble enough \
hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents \
night and day and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continued \
the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should \
be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh \
serpent but i m not a serpent i tell you said alice i m a i m a i m a little \
girl she added rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she \
had gone through that day you re looking for eggs i know that well enough \
said the pigeon and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or \
a serpent it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m not looking \
for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn t want yours i don t like them \
raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again \
into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for \
her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she \
had to stop and untwist it after awhile she remembered that she still held \
the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully \
nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and \
sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her \
usual height it was so long since she had been anything near the right size \
that it felt quite strange at first the next thing is to get into that \
beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came \
suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high \
whoever lives there thought alice it ll never do to come upon them this size \
why i should frighten them out of their wits she did not venture to go near \
the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high vi pig and \
pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood judging by his face only she \
would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles \
it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes \
like a frog the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great \
letter and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the \
duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman \
repeated in the same solemn tone from the queen an invitation for the duchess \
to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled \
together when alice next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other \
was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky \
alice went timidly up to the door and knocked there s no sort of use in \
knocking said the footman and that for two reasons first because i m on the \
same side of the door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise \
inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most \
extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every \
now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces \
how am i to get in asked alice are you to get in at all said the footman that \
s the first question you know alice opened the door and went in the door led \
right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other \
the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby \
the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large caldron which seemed to \
be full of soup there s certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to \
herself as well as she could for sneezing even the duchess sneezed \
occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately \
without a moment s pause the only two creatures in the kitchen that did not \
sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was grinning from ear to ear \
please would you tell me said alice a little timidly why your cat grins like \
that it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why i didn t know that \
cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didn t know that cats could grin said \
alice you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came \
first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took \
no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much \
already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not \
oh please mind what you re doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony \
of terror here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice \
flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet \
with the queen and she hurried out of the room alice caught the baby with \
some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its \
arms and legs in all directions if i don t take this child away with me \
thought alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder \
to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing \
grunted in reply if you re going to turn into a pig my dear said alice i ll \
have nothing more to do with you mind now alice was just beginning to think \
to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it \
grunted again so violently that alice looked down into its face in some alarm \
this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less \
than a pig so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see \
it trot away quietly into the wood alice was a little startled by seeing the \
cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only \
grinned when it saw her cheshire puss began alice rather timidly would you \
please tell me which way i ought to go from here in that direction the cat \
said waving the right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving \
the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like they re both mad but i \
don t want to go among mad people alice remarked oh you can t help that said \
the cat we re all mad here do you play croquet with the queen to day i should \
like it very much said alice but i haven t been invited yet you ll see me \
there said the cat and vanished alice had not gone much farther before she \
came in sight of the house of the march hare it was so large a house that she \
did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the left hand bit \
of mushroom vii a mad tea party there was a table set out under a tree in \
front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a \
dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep the table was a large one but \
the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they \
cried out when they saw alice coming there s plenty of room said alice \
indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table the \
hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a \
raven like a writing desk i m glad they ve begun asking riddles i believe i \
can guess that she added aloud do you mean that you think you can find out \
the answer to it said the march hare exactly so said alice then you should \
say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hastily replied at least \
at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know you might just as \
well say added the dormouse which seemed to be talking in its sleep that i \
breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe it is the \
same thing with you said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its \
nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its \
eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself have you \
guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again no i give it up \
alice replied what s the answer i haven t the slightest idea said the hatter \
nor i said the march hare alice gave a weary sigh i think you might do \
something better with the time she said than wasting it in asking riddles \
that have no answers take some more tea the march hare said to alice very \
earnestly i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can t \
take more you mean you can t take less said the hatter it s very easy to take \
more than nothing at this alice got up and walked off the dormouse fell \
asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going \
though she looked back once or twice the last time she saw them they were \
trying to put the dormouse into the tea pot at any rate i ll never go there \
again said alice as she picked her way through the wood it s the stupidest \
tea party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that \
one of the trees had a door leading right into it that s very curious she \
thought i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she \
found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table taking the \
little golden key she unlocked the door that led into the garden then she set \
to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket \
till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and \
then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright \
flower beds and the cool fountains viii the queen s croquet ground a large \
rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were \
white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red suddenly \
their eyes chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them would you \
tell me please said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses \
five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why \
the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we \
put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should \
all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss we re doing our best \
afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across \
the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly \
threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps \
and alice looked round eager to see the queen first came ten soldiers \
carrying clubs with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten \
courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds after these came the \
royal children there were ten of them all ornamented with hearts next came \
the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognized the white \
rabbit then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king s crown on a \
crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king \
and the queen of hearts when the procession came opposite to alice they all \
stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it \
to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply my name is alice so \
please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why \
they re only a pack of cards after all can you play croquet shouted the queen \
the question was evidently meant for alice yes said alice loudly come on then \
roared the queen it s it s a very fine day said a timid voice to alice she \
was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face very \
said alice where s the duchess hush hush said the rabbit she s under sentence \
of execution what for said alice she boxed the queen s ears the rabbit began \
get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began \
running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they \
got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had \
never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and \
furrows the croquet balls were live hedgehogs and the mallets live flamingos \
and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and \
feet to make the arches the players all played at once without waiting for \
turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very \
short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and \
shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute they \
re dreadfully fond of beheading people here thought alice the great wonder is \
that there s anyone left alive she was looking about for some way of escape \
when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it s the cheshire cat she \
said to herself now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on \
said the cat i don t think they play at all fairly alice said in a rather \
complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself \
speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular how do you like the \
queen said the cat in a low voice not at all said alice alice thought she \
might as well go back and see how the game was going on so she went off in \
search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another \
hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of \
them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across \
to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless \
sort of way to fly up into a tree she caught the flamingo and tucked it away \
under her arm that it might not escape again just then alice ran across the \
duchess who was now out of prison she tucked her arm affectionately into \
alice s and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper she was a little startled however when she heard the voice \
of the duchess close to her ear you re thinking about something my dear and \
that makes you forget to talk the game s going on rather better now alice \
said by way of keeping up the conversation a little tis so said the duchess \
and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round \
somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding his own \
business ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her \
sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is \
take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves to alice s \
great surprise the duchess s arm that was linked into hers began to tremble \
alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms \
folded frowning like a thunderstorm now i give you fair warning shouted the \
queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off \
and that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice \
and was gone in a moment let s go on with the game the queen said to alice \
and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back \
to the croquet ground all the time they were playing the queen never left off \
quarreling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with \
her head by the end of half an hour or so all the players except the king the \
queen and alice were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of \
execution then the queen left off quite out of breath and walked away with \
alice alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you \
are all pardoned suddenly the cry the trial s beginning was heard in the \
distance and alice ran along with the others ix who stole the tarts the king \
and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a \
great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well \
as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with \
a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit \
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very \
middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it i wish \
they d get the trial done alice thought and hand round the refreshments the \
judge by the way was the king and he wore his crown over his great wig that s \
the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures some were animals and \
some were birds i suppose they are the jurors just then the white rabbit \
cried out silence in the court herald read the accusation said the king on \
this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet then unrolled the \
parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts \
all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them \
quite away call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew \
three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness the first witness \
was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and \
butter in the other you ought to have finished said the king when did you \
begin the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court \
arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it was he said give \
your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on \
the spot this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting \
from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion \
he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter just \
at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation she was beginning to grow \
larger again the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and \
went down on one knee i m a poor man your majesty he began you re a very poor \
speaker said the king you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left \
the court call the next witness said the king the next witness was the \
duchess s cook she carried the pepper box in her hand and the people near the \
door began sneezing all at once give your evidence said the king sha n t said \
the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low \
voice your majesty must cross examine this witness well if i must i must the \
king said what are tarts made of pepper mostly said the cook for some minutes \
the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled down again \
the cook had disappeared never mind said the king call the next witness alice \
watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list imagine her surprise \
when he read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice x alice \
s evidence here cried alice she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury box upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay the trial \
cannot proceed said the king until all the jurymen are back in their proper \
places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice what do you \
know about this business the king said to alice nothing whatever said alice \
the king then read from his book rule forty two all persons more than a mile \
high to leave the court i m not a mile high said alice nearly two miles high \
said the queen well i sha n t go at any rate said alice the king turned pale \
and shut his note book hastily consider your verdict he said to the jury in a \
low trembling voice there s more evidence to come yet please your majesty \
said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been \
picked up it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody he \
unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a \
set of verses please your majesty said the knave i didn t write it and they \
can t prove that i did there s no name signed at the end you must have meant \
some mischief or else you d have signed your name like an honest man said the \
king there was a general clapping of hands at this read them he added turning \
to the white rabbit there was dead silence in the court whilst the white \
rabbit read out the verses that s the most important piece of evidence we ve \
heard yet said the king i don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it \
ventured alice if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a world \
of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any let the jury consider their \
verdict no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards stuff and \
nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence first hold your \
tongue said the queen turning purple i won t said alice off with her head the \
queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody moved who cares for you said \
alice she had grown to her full size by this time you re nothing but a pack \
of cards at this the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon \
her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to \
beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of \
her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered \
down from the trees upon her face wake up alice dear said her sister why what \
a long sleep you ve had oh i ve had such a curious dream said alice and she \
told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange \
adventures of hers that you have just been reading about alice got up and ran \
off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had \

       "I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE Alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures \
or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \
\"without pictures or conversations?\" So she was considering in her own mind \
(as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of \
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink \
eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did \
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took \
a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out \
of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was \
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In \
another moment, down went Alice after it! The rabbit-hole went straight on \
like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that \
Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found \
herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Either the well was \
very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went \
down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, \
but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well \
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and \
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one \
of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to \
her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so \
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Down, down, \
down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so \
Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I \
should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of \
milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\" Alice \
felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon \
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit \
hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark \
overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still \
in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went \
Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a \
corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close \
behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be \
seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of \
lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but they \
were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the \
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she \
was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of \
solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first \
idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! \
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, \
it would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came \
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little \
door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, \
and to her great delight, it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it \
led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and \
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she \
longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of \
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a \
telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\" Alice went back to \
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a \
book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a \
little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said Alice), \
and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \
\"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. \"No, I'll look \
first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not,\" for she \
had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is \
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle \
was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it \
very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, \
roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off. * \
* * * * \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like \
a telescope!\" And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and \
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \
going through the little door into that lovely garden. After awhile, finding \
that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; \
but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had \
forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, \
she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with \
trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \"Come, there's no use in \
crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather sharply. \"I advise you to \
leave off this minute!\" She generally gave herself very good advice (though \
she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely \
as to bring tears into her eyes. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that \
was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, \
on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, \
I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the \
key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either \
way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\" She ate a \
little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which way?\" holding \
her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she \
was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to \
work and very soon finished off the cake. II--THE POOL OF TEARS \"Curiouser \
and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment \
she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I'm opening out like the \
largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I \
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\" Just at this \
moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now \
rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden \
key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she \
could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one \
eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began \
to cry again. She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large \
pool all 'round her and reaching half down the hall. After a time, she heard \
a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to \
see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, \
with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He \
came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the \
Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\" \
When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you \
please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves \
and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice \
took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went \
on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday \
things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got up this morning? \
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, \
_that's_ the great puzzle!\" As she said this, she looked down at her hands \
and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white \
kid-gloves while she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she \
thought. \"I must be growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table \
to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and \
was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was \
the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save \
herself from shrinking away altogether. \"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said \
Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find \
herself still in existence. \"And now for the garden!\" And she ran with all \
speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and \
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \"Things are \
worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this \
before, never!\" As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another \
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that \
she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was \
in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. Just \
then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and \
she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a \
mouse that had slipped in like herself. \"Would it be of any use, now,\" \
thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down \
here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no \
harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this \
pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at \
her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little \
eyes, but it said nothing. \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought \
Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the \
Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"O\[CapitalATilde]\.b9 est ma chatte?\" \
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a \
sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, \
I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor \
animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\" \"Not like \
cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like \
cats, if you were me?\" \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \
\"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I \
think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a \
dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it \
must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather \
not.\" \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of \
its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ \
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\" \"I \
won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of \
conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice \
little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats \
and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended \
it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, \
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly \
after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or \
dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned \
'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in \
a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my \
history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\" It was high \
time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals \
that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, \
and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party \
swam to the shore. III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE They were indeed a \
queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled \
feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping \
wet, cross and uncomfortable. The first question, of course, was how to get \
dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it \
seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, \
as if she had known them all her life. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a \
person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and \
listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, \
in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with \
an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. \
Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was \
favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted \
leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. \
Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\" \"Ugh!\" said the \
Lory, with a shiver. \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of \
Canterbury, found it advisable'--\" \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck. \"Found \
_it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' \
means.\" \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said \
the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the \
archbishop find?\" The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went \
on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and \
offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, \
turning to Alice as it spoke. \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy \
tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\" \"In that case,\" said the Dodo \
solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the \
immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\" \"Speak English!\" said the \
Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's \
more, I don't believe you do either!\" \"What I was going to say,\" said the \
Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a \
Caucus-race.\" \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice. \"Why,\" said the \
Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a \
race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along \
the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but \
they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it \
was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called \
out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and \
asking, \"But who has won?\" This question the Dodo could not answer without \
a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ \
must have prizes.\" \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of \
voices asked. \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice \
with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, \
in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\" Alice had no idea what to do, and in \
despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits \
(luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as \
prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round. The next thing was to eat \
the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds \
complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and \
had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down \
again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. \"You \
promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you \
hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be \
offended again. \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to \
Alice and sighing. \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking \
down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she \
kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of \
the tale was something like this:-- \"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in \
the house, 'Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-- Come, I'll \
take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing \
to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or \
judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said \
cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\" \
\"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you \
thinking of?\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got \
to the fifth bend, I think?\" \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" \
said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \"Please come back and finish \
your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \
\"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker. \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This \
caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off \
at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \
\"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various \
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone. \"I wish I hadn't \
mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the \
best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very \
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little \
pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly. IV--THE \
RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back \
again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; \
Alice heard it muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear \
paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are \
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a \
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and \
she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere \
to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and \
the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished \
completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an \
angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\" \"He took me \
for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be \
when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little \
house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. \
RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, \
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the \
house before she had found the fan and gloves. By this time, Alice had found \
her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan \
and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a \
pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell \
upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and \
put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large \
again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\" \
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the \
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put \
down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any \
more.\" Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing \
and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, \
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up \
the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. \
What _will_ become of me?\" Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had \
now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard \
a voice outside and stopped to listen. \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the \
voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Then came a little pattering of \
feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and \
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now \
about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid \
of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as \
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that \
attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll go 'round \
and get in at the window.\" \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after \
waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she \
suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get \
hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of \
broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had \
fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort. Next came an angry \
voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And then a voice she had \
never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\" \
\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the \
window?\" \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\" \"Well, it's got no business \
there, at any rate; go and take it away!\" There was a long silence after \
this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread \
out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were \
_two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll \
do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish \
they _could_!\" She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At \
last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many \
voices all talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other \
ladder? Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to \
go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master \
says you've got to go down the chimney!\" Alice drew her foot as far down the \
chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and \
scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick \
and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a \
general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch \
him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence and then another confusion of \
voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--What happened to \
you?\" Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No \
more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me like a \
Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" After a minute or two of \
silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A \
barrowful will do, to begin with.\" \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. \
But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles \
came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice \
noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little \
cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I \
eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in \
my size.\" So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that \
she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through \
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals \
and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she \
appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in \
a thick wood. \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as \
she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the \
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to \
eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'\" Alice \
looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could \
not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same \
height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the \
edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was \
sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. V--ADVICE FROM A \
CATERPILLAR At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice. \"Who are _you_?\" said the \
Caterpillar. Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at \
present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think \
I must have changed several times since then.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \
said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain yourself!\" \"I can't explain \
_myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm not myself, you \
see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\" She drew \
herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you ought to tell me who _you_ \
are, first.\" \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar. As Alice could not think of any \
good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of \
mind, she turned away. \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \
\"I've something important to say!\" Alice turned and came back again. \"Keep \
your temper,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing \
down her anger as well as she could. \"No,\" said the Caterpillar. It \
unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you \
think you're changed, do you?\" \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I \
can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten \
minutes together!\" \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar. \
\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one \
doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_ \
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a \
wretched height to be.\" \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the \
Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three \
inches high). In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom \
and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side \
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\" \
\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to herself. \
\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; \
and in another moment, it was out of sight. Alice remained looking \
thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the \
two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they \
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. \"And now which is \
which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to \
try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her \
chin--it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very \
sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to \
eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot \
that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and \
managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.... \"Come, my head's free \
at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an \
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of \
green leaves that lay far below her. \"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And \
oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\" She was delighted to find \
that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She \
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to \
dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a \
large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its \
wings. \"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon. \"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice \
indignantly. \"Let me alone!\" \"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've \
tried banks, and I've tried hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those \
serpents! There's no pleasing them!\" Alice was more and more puzzled. \"As \
if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon, \"but I \
must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken \
the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a \
shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they \
must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\" \"But I'm _not_ \
a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a little girl,\" she \
added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone \
through that day. \"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" \
said the Pigeon; \"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl \
or a serpent?\" \"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but \
I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want \
_yours_--I don't like them raw.\" \"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in \
a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down \
among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled \
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. \
After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her \
hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at \
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had \
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since \
she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at \
first. \"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that \
to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open \
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\
\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size; why, I \
should frighten them out of their wits!\" She did not venture to go near the \
house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. VI--PIG AND \
PEPPER For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she \
would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his \
knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and \
large eyes like a frog. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his \
arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn \
tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The \
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An \
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low and \
their curls got entangled together. When Alice next peeped out, the \
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, \
staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door and \
knocked. \"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that \
for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; \
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly \
hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on \
within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great \
crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \"How am I to get \
in?\" asked Alice. \"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's \
the first question, you know.\" Alice opened the door and went in. The door \
led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the \
other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing \
a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which \
seemed to be full of soup. \"There's certainly too much pepper in that \
soup!\" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. Even the \
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and \
howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the \
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was \
grinning from ear to ear. \"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why your cat grins like that?\" \"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the \
Duchess, \"and that's why.\" \"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always \
grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice. \"You \
don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\" Just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came \
first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess \
took no notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so \
much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or \
not. \"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and \
down in an agony of terror. \"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" \
the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go \
and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the \
room. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped \
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I \
don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to kill \
it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She said the \
last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply. \"If you're going \
to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have nothing more to do \
with you. Mind now!\" Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, \
what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted \
again so violently that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This \
time there could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than \
a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it \
trot away quietly into the wood. Alice was a little startled by seeing the \
Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only \
grinned when it saw her. \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \
\"would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?\" \"In _that_ \
direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives a Hatter; and \
in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit \
either you like; they're both mad.\" \"But I don't want to go among mad \
people,\" Alice remarked. \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're \
all mad here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\" \"I should like it \
very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited yet.\" \"You'll see me \
there,\" said the Cat, and vanished. Alice had not gone much farther before \
she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; it was so large a house \
that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the \
left-hand bit of mushroom. VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY There was a table set out \
under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were \
having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep. The table \
was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. \
\"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \"There's \
_plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large \
arm-chair at one end of the table. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on \
hearing this, but all he said was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\" \
\"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she \
added aloud. \"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to \
it?\" said the March Hare. \"Exactly so,\" said Alice. \"Then you should say \
what you mean,\" the March Hare went on. \"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \
\"at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.\" \
\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be \
talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I \
sleep when I breathe!'\" \"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the \
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its \
head impatiently and said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; \
just what I was going to remark myself.\" \"Have you guessed the riddle \
yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \"No, I give it up,\" Alice \
replied. \"What's the answer?\" \"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the \
Hatter. \"Nor I,\" said the March Hare. Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think \
you might do something better with the time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in \
asking riddles that have no answers.\" \"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare \
said to Alice, very earnestly. \"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an \
offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\" \"You mean you can't take _less_,\" \
said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\" At this, \
Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither \
of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once \
or twice; the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse \
into the tea-pot. \"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, \
as she picked her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever \
was at in all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the \
trees had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \
\"I think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went. Once more she found \
herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. Taking the \
little golden key, she unlocked the door that led into the garden. Then she \
set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her \
pocket) till she was about a foot high; then she walked down the little \
passage; and _then_--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among \
the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET \
GROUND A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses \
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily \
painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as she \
stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\" Five and Seven said nothing, \
but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, \
Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one \
in by mistake; and, if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our \
heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she \
comes, to--\" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the \
garden, called out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners \
instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many \
footsteps and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten \
soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the \
ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came \
the royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next \
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the \
White Rabbit. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on \
a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING \
AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all \
stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She \
said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \"My name \
is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely; but she added \
to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!\" \"Can you play \
croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for Alice. \
\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly. \"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen. \"It's--it's \
a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by the White \
Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \"Very,\" said Alice. \
\"Where's the Duchess?\" \"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under \
sentence of execution.\" \"What for?\" said Alice. \"She boxed the Queen's \
ears--\" the Rabbit began. \"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a \
voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling \
up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and \
the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious \
croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls \
were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to \
double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. \
The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all \
the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen \
was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, \"Off with his \
head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute. \"They're \
dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the great wonder \
is that there's anyone left alive!\" She was looking about for some way of \
escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. \"It's the \
Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself; \"now I shall have somebody to talk \
to.\" \"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat. \"I don't think they play at \
all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; \"and they all \
quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to \
have any rules in particular.\" \"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat \
in a low voice. \"Not at all,\" said Alice. Alice thought she might as well \
go back and see how the game was going on. So she went off in search of her \
hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which \
seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the \
other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other \
side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of \
way, to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under \
her arm, that it might not escape again. Just then Alice ran across the \
Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her arm affectionately into \
Alice's and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper. She was a little startled, however, when she heard the \
voice of the Duchess close to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my \
dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\" \"The game's going on rather \
better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. \
\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love, \
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'\" \"Somebody said,\" Alice \
whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding his own business!\" \"Ah, \
well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her sharp \
little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of _that_ \
is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.'\" \
To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers began \
to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them, with \
her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm! \"Now, I give you fair \
warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke, \"either \
you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your \
choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \"Let's go \
on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much \
frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. \
All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with the \
other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" \
By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the King, the Queen \
and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution. \
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with Alice. \
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You are \
all pardoned.\" Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the \
distance, and Alice ran along with the others. IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS? The \
King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with \
a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as \
well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in \
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the \
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the \
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of \
tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" Alice thought, \"and \
hand 'round the refreshments!\" The judge, by the way, was the King and he \
wore his crown over his great wig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \
\"and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I \
suppose they are the jurors.\" Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence \
in the court!\" \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King. On this, the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the \
parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some \
tarts, All on a summer day; The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And \
took them quite away!\" \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First \
witness!\" The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one \
hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. \"You ought to have \
finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\" The Hatter looked at the \
March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the \
Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\" he said. \"Give your \
evidence,\" said the King, \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed \
on the spot.\" This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept \
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in \
his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread \
and butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was \
beginning to grow larger again. The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and \
bread and butter and went down on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" \
he began. \"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King. \"You may go,\" \
said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court. \"Call the next \
witness!\" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She \
carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began \
sneezing all at once. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King. \"Sha'n't,\" \
said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a \
low voice, \"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\" \"Well, if I \
must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\" \"Pepper, \
mostly,\" said the cook. For some minutes the whole court was in confusion \
and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \
\"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\" Alice watched the \
White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read \
out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"Alice!\" X--ALICE'S \
EVIDENCE \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below. \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay. \
\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are back \
in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking \
hard at Alice. \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to \
Alice. \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice. The King then read from his book: \
\"Rule forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\" \
\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice. \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the \
Queen. \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice. The King turned pale \
and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your verdict,\" he said to the \
jury, in a low, trembling voice. \"There's more evidence to come yet, please \
Your Majesty,\" said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This \
paper has just been picked up. It seems to be a letter written by the \
prisoner to--to somebody.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It \
isn't a letter, after all; it's a set of verses.\" \"Please, Your Majesty,\" \
said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; there's \
no name signed at the end.\" \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else \
you'd have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a \
general clapping of hands at this. \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the \
White Rabbit. There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit \
read out the verses. \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've \
heard yet,\" said the King. \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in \
it,\" ventured Alice. \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that \
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the \
jury consider their verdict.\" \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence \
first--verdict afterwards.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The \
idea of having the sentence first!\" \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, \
turning purple. \"I won't!\" said Alice. \"Off with her head!\" the Queen \
shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \"Who cares for _you_?\" said \
Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). \"You're nothing but a \
pack of cards!\" At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying \
down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, \
and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her \
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves \
that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \"Wake up, Alice \
dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've had!\" \"Oh, I've \
had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as \
she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have \
just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as \
well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.", $CellContext`textProc = 
       "i down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or \
conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without \
pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as \
she could for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the \
pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and \
picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by \
her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so \
very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i \
shall be too late but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its \
waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her \
feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit \
with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with \
curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it \
pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went \
alice after it the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way \
and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to \
think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what \
seemed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very \
slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her first \
she tried to make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see \
anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were \
filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and \
pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she \
passed it was labeled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was \
empty she did not like to drop the jar so managed to put it into one of the \
cupboards as she fell past it down down down would the fall never come to an \
end there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking to herself dinah \
ll miss me very much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope they ll \
remember her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down \
here with me alice felt that she was dozing off when suddenly thump thump \
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over \
alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up in a moment she looked up but it \
was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white \
rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost \
away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it \
turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting she was close \
behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen \
she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps \
hanging from the roof there were doors all round the hall but they were all \
locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other \
trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever \
to get out again suddenly she came upon a little table all made of solid \
glass there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alice s first idea \
was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either \
the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would \
not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low \
curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about \
fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her \
great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a \
small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along \
the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out \
of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and \
those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway \
oh said alice how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if \
i only knew how to begin alice went back to the table half hoping she might \
find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up \
like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was \
not here before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper \
label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters no i \
ll look first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not for she had \
never forgotten that if you drink from a bottle marked poison it is almost \
certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not \
marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had a \
sort of mixed flavor of cherry tart custard pineapple roast turkey toffy and \
hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off what a curious feeling said \
alice i must be shutting up like a telescope and so it was indeed she was now \
only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was \
now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden \
after awhile finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the \
garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she \
had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for \
it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying \
the poor little thing sat down and cried come there s no use in crying like \
that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this \
minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom \
followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears \
into her eyes soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under \
the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words \
eat me were beautifully marked in currants well i ll eat it said alice and if \
it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i \
can creep under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i don t \
care which happens she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which \
way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she \
was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same \
size so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake ii the pool of \
tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for \
the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now i m opening out \
like the largest telescope that ever was good by feet oh my poor little feet \
i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears i shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you just at this moment \
her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now rather more \
than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried \
off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down \
on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through \
was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again she went on \
shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her and \
reaching half down the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet \
in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was \
the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves \
in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great \
hurry muttering to himself oh the duchess the duchess oh won t she be savage \
if i ve kept her waiting when the rabbit came near her alice began in a low \
timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white \
kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he \
could go alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all \
the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day and \
yesterday things went on just as usual was i the same when i got up this \
morning but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah \
that s the great puzzle as she said this she looked down at her hands and was \
surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid \
gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be \
growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it \
and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking \
rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding \
and she dropped it hastily just in time to save herself from shrinking away \
altogether that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the \
sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for \
the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the \
little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass \
table as before things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never \
was so small as this before never as she said these words her foot slipped \
and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first \
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea however she soon made out \
that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet \
high just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way \
off and she swam nearer to see what it was she soon made out that it was only \
a mouse that had slipped in like herself would it be of any use now thought \
alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here that i \
should think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in trying so \
she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of \
swimming about here o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and \
seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing perhaps \
it doesn t understand english thought alice i dare say it s a french mouse \
come over with william the conqueror so she began again o\[ATilde] est ma \
chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson book the mouse gave \
a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i \
beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal \
s feelings i quite forgot you didn t like cats not like cats cried the mouse \
in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me well perhaps \
not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it and yet i wish i \
could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could \
only see her she is such a dear quiet thing the mouse was bristling all over \
and she felt certain it must be really offended we won t talk about her any \
more if you d rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to \
the end of its tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always \
hated cats nasty low vulgar things don t let me hear the name again i won t \
indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are \
you are you fond of of dogs there is such a nice little dog near our house i \
should like to show you it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a \
sorrowful tone i m afraid i ve offended it again for the mouse was swimming \
away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool \
as it went so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we \
won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them when the mouse \
heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite \
pale and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i \
ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs \
it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds \
and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and \
an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole \
party swam to the shore iii a caucus race and a long tale they were indeed a \
queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled \
feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping \
wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course was how to get dry \
again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed \
quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she \
had known them all her life at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of \
some authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me i \
ll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with \
the mouse in the middle ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all \
ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william \
the conqueror whose cause was favored by the pope was soon submitted to by \
the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to \
usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria \
ugh said the lory with a shiver and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of \
canterbury found it advisable found what said the duck found it the mouse \
replied rather crossly of course you know what it means i know what it means \
well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a worm \
the question is what did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this \
question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling \
to meet william and offer him the crown how are you getting on now my dear it \
continued turning to alice as it spoke as wet as ever said alice in a \
melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all in that case said the dodo \
solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate \
adoption of more energetic remedies speak english said the eaglet i don t \
know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you \
do either what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone is that \
the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race what is a caucus race \
said alice why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it first it \
marked out a race course in a sort of circle and then all the party were \
placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away \
but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that \
it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called \
out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who \
has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of \
thought at last it said everybody has won and all must have prizes but who is \
to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked why she of course said the \
dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded \
round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes alice had no idea what \
to do and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of \
comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as \
prizes there was exactly one a piece all round the next thing was to eat the \
comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained \
that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be \
patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a \
ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more you promised to tell me \
your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in \
a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again mine is a long and a \
sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing it is a long tail \
certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail but why do \
you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was \
speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a \
mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you \
come i ll take no denial we must have the trial for really this morning i ve \
nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or \
judge would be wasting our breath i ll be judge i ll be jury said cunning old \
fury i ll try the whole cause and condemn you to death you are not attending \
said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of i beg your pardon \
said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think you insult me by \
talking such nonsense said the mouse getting up and walking away please come \
back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in \
chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker i wish i had dinah our cat here said alice this caused a \
remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once \
and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my \
dears it s high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved \
off and alice was soon left alone i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah nobody \
seems to like her down here and i m sure she s the best cat in the world poor \
alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited in a \
little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the \
distance and she looked up eagerly iv the rabbit sends in a little bill it \
was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about \
as it went as if it had lost something alice heard it muttering to itself the \
duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she ll get me \
executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i \
wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair \
of white kid gloves and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them \
but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her \
swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door \
had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice and called to her \
in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now he took me for his \
housemaid said alice as she ran off how surprised he ll be when he finds out \
who i am as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of \
which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she \
went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should \
meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found \
the fan and gloves by this time alice had found her way into a tidy little \
room with a table in the window and on it a fan and two or three pairs of \
tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was \
just going to leave the room when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that \
stood near the looking glass she uncorked it and put it to her lips saying to \
herself i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired \
of being such a tiny little thing before she had drunk half the bottle she \
found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck \
from being broken she hastily put down the bottle remarking that s quite \
enough i hope i sha n t grow any more alas it was too late to wish that she \
went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor \
still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the \
window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more \
whatever happens what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic \
bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger after a few minutes \
she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen mary ann mary ann said the \
voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on \
the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she \
trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a \
thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it \
presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door \
opened inwards and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt \
proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then i ll go round and get in \
at the window that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she fancied \
she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand \
and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a \
little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded \
that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of \
that sort next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat pat where are you and \
then a voice she had never heard before sure then i m here digging for apples \
yer honor here come and help me out of this now tell me pat what s that in \
the window sure it s an arm yer honor well it s got no business there at any \
rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could \
only hear whispers now and then and at last she spread out her hand again and \
made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and \
more sounds of broken glass i wonder what they ll do next thought alice as \
for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could she waited for some \
time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cart \
wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out \
the words where s the other ladder bill s got the other bill here bill will \
the roof bear who s to go down the chimney nay i sha n t you do it here bill \
the master says you ve got to go down the chimney alice drew her foot as far \
down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal \
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then she gave \
one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next the first thing she \
heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit s voice alone \
catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices \
hold up his head brandy now don t choke him what happened to you last came a \
little feeble squeaking voice well i hardly know no more thank ye i m better \
now all i know is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes \
like a sky rocket after a minute or two of silence they began moving about \
again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with a \
barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next \
moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of \
them hit her in the face alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles \
were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea \
came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make \
some change in my size so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to \
find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get \
through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little \
animals and birds waiting outside they all made a rush at alice the moment \
she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe \
in a thick wood the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she \
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second \
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i suppose i ought to eat or \
drink something or other but the great question is what alice looked all \
around her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she could not see \
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same \
height as herself she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge \
and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was \
sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else v advice from a \
caterpillar at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed alice in a languid sleepy voice who are you said the caterpillar \
alice replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present at least i \
know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have changed \
several times since then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar \
sternly explain yourself i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice \
because i m not myself you see being so many different sizes in a day is very \
confusing she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell \
me who you are first why said the caterpillar as alice could not think of any \
good reason and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of \
mind she turned away come back the caterpillar called after her i ve \
something important to say alice turned and came back again keep your temper \
said the caterpillar is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well \
as she could no said the caterpillar it unfolded its arms took the hookah out \
of its mouth again and said so you think you re changed do you i m afraid i \
am sir said alice i can t remember things as i used and i don t keep the same \
size for ten minutes together what size do you want to be asked the \
caterpillar oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one \
doesn t like changing so often you know i should like to be a little larger \
sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to \
be it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing \
itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high in a minute or \
two the caterpillar got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass \
merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other \
side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side of what \
thought alice to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she \
had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained \
looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which \
were the two sides of it at last she stretched her arms round it as far as \
they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is \
which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try \
the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had \
struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change as \
she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other \
bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly \
room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel \
of the left hand bit come my head s free at last said alice but all she could \
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise \
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her where have \
my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i can t see you she was \
delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like \
a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag \
and was going to dive in among the leaves when a sharp hiss made her draw \
back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her \
violently with its wings serpent cried the pigeon i m not a serpent said \
alice indignantly let me alone i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried \
banks and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on but those serpents there s no \
pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled as if it wasn t trouble enough \
hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents \
night and day and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continued \
the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should \
be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh \
serpent but i m not a serpent i tell you said alice i m a i m a i m a little \
girl she added rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she \
had gone through that day you re looking for eggs i know that well enough \
said the pigeon and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or \
a serpent it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m not looking \
for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn t want yours i don t like them \
raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again \
into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for \
her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she \
had to stop and untwist it after awhile she remembered that she still held \
the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully \
nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and \
sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her \
usual height it was so long since she had been anything near the right size \
that it felt quite strange at first the next thing is to get into that \
beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came \
suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high \
whoever lives there thought alice it ll never do to come upon them this size \
why i should frighten them out of their wits she did not venture to go near \
the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high vi pig and \
pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood judging by his face only she \
would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles \
it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes \
like a frog the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great \
letter and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the \
duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman \
repeated in the same solemn tone from the queen an invitation for the duchess \
to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled \
together when alice next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other \
was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky \
alice went timidly up to the door and knocked there s no sort of use in \
knocking said the footman and that for two reasons first because i m on the \
same side of the door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise \
inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most \
extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every \
now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces \
how am i to get in asked alice are you to get in at all said the footman that \
s the first question you know alice opened the door and went in the door led \
right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other \
the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby \
the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large caldron which seemed to \
be full of soup there s certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to \
herself as well as she could for sneezing even the duchess sneezed \
occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately \
without a moment s pause the only two creatures in the kitchen that did not \
sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was grinning from ear to ear \
please would you tell me said alice a little timidly why your cat grins like \
that it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why i didn t know that \
cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didn t know that cats could grin said \
alice you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came \
first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took \
no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much \
already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not \
oh please mind what you re doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony \
of terror here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice \
flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet \
with the queen and she hurried out of the room alice caught the baby with \
some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its \
arms and legs in all directions if i don t take this child away with me \
thought alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder \
to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing \
grunted in reply if you re going to turn into a pig my dear said alice i ll \
have nothing more to do with you mind now alice was just beginning to think \
to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it \
grunted again so violently that alice looked down into its face in some alarm \
this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less \
than a pig so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see \
it trot away quietly into the wood alice was a little startled by seeing the \
cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only \
grinned when it saw her cheshire puss began alice rather timidly would you \
please tell me which way i ought to go from here in that direction the cat \
said waving the right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving \
the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like they re both mad but i \
don t want to go among mad people alice remarked oh you can t help that said \
the cat we re all mad here do you play croquet with the queen to day i should \
like it very much said alice but i haven t been invited yet you ll see me \
there said the cat and vanished alice had not gone much farther before she \
came in sight of the house of the march hare it was so large a house that she \
did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the left hand bit \
of mushroom vii a mad tea party there was a table set out under a tree in \
front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a \
dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep the table was a large one but \
the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they \
cried out when they saw alice coming there s plenty of room said alice \
indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table the \
hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a \
raven like a writing desk i m glad they ve begun asking riddles i believe i \
can guess that she added aloud do you mean that you think you can find out \
the answer to it said the march hare exactly so said alice then you should \
say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hastily replied at least \
at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know you might just as \
well say added the dormouse which seemed to be talking in its sleep that i \
breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe it is the \
same thing with you said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its \
nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its \
eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself have you \
guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again no i give it up \
alice replied what s the answer i haven t the slightest idea said the hatter \
nor i said the march hare alice gave a weary sigh i think you might do \
something better with the time she said than wasting it in asking riddles \
that have no answers take some more tea the march hare said to alice very \
earnestly i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can t \
take more you mean you can t take less said the hatter it s very easy to take \
more than nothing at this alice got up and walked off the dormouse fell \
asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going \
though she looked back once or twice the last time she saw them they were \
trying to put the dormouse into the tea pot at any rate i ll never go there \
again said alice as she picked her way through the wood it s the stupidest \
tea party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that \
one of the trees had a door leading right into it that s very curious she \
thought i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she \
found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table taking the \
little golden key she unlocked the door that led into the garden then she set \
to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket \
till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and \
then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright \
flower beds and the cool fountains viii the queen s croquet ground a large \
rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were \
white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red suddenly \
their eyes chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them would you \
tell me please said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses \
five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why \
the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we \
put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should \
all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss we re doing our best \
afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across \
the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly \
threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps \
and alice looked round eager to see the queen first came ten soldiers \
carrying clubs with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten \
courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds after these came the \
royal children there were ten of them all ornamented with hearts next came \
the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognized the white \
rabbit then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king s crown on a \
crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king \
and the queen of hearts when the procession came opposite to alice they all \
stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it \
to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply my name is alice so \
please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why \
they re only a pack of cards after all can you play croquet shouted the queen \
the question was evidently meant for alice yes said alice loudly come on then \
roared the queen it s it s a very fine day said a timid voice to alice she \
was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face very \
said alice where s the duchess hush hush said the rabbit she s under sentence \
of execution what for said alice she boxed the queen s ears the rabbit began \
get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began \
running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they \
got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had \
never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and \
furrows the croquet balls were live hedgehogs and the mallets live flamingos \
and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and \
feet to make the arches the players all played at once without waiting for \
turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very \
short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and \
shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute they \
re dreadfully fond of beheading people here thought alice the great wonder is \
that there s anyone left alive she was looking about for some way of escape \
when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it s the cheshire cat she \
said to herself now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on \
said the cat i don t think they play at all fairly alice said in a rather \
complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself \
speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular how do you like the \
queen said the cat in a low voice not at all said alice alice thought she \
might as well go back and see how the game was going on so she went off in \
search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another \
hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of \
them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across \
to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless \
sort of way to fly up into a tree she caught the flamingo and tucked it away \
under her arm that it might not escape again just then alice ran across the \
duchess who was now out of prison she tucked her arm affectionately into \
alice s and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper she was a little startled however when she heard the voice \
of the duchess close to her ear you re thinking about something my dear and \
that makes you forget to talk the game s going on rather better now alice \
said by way of keeping up the conversation a little tis so said the duchess \
and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round \
somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding his own \
business ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her \
sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is \
take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves to alice s \
great surprise the duchess s arm that was linked into hers began to tremble \
alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms \
folded frowning like a thunderstorm now i give you fair warning shouted the \
queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off \
and that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice \
and was gone in a moment let s go on with the game the queen said to alice \
and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back \
to the croquet ground all the time they were playing the queen never left off \
quarreling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with \
her head by the end of half an hour or so all the players except the king the \
queen and alice were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of \
execution then the queen left off quite out of breath and walked away with \
alice alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you \
are all pardoned suddenly the cry the trial s beginning was heard in the \
distance and alice ran along with the others ix who stole the tarts the king \
and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a \
great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well \
as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with \
a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit \
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very \
middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it i wish \
they d get the trial done alice thought and hand round the refreshments the \
judge by the way was the king and he wore his crown over his great wig that s \
the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures some were animals and \
some were birds i suppose they are the jurors just then the white rabbit \
cried out silence in the court herald read the accusation said the king on \
this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet then unrolled the \
parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts \
all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them \
quite away call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew \
three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness the first witness \
was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and \
butter in the other you ought to have finished said the king when did you \
begin the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court \
arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it was he said give \
your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on \
the spot this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting \
from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion \
he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter just \
at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation she was beginning to grow \
larger again the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and \
went down on one knee i m a poor man your majesty he began you re a very poor \
speaker said the king you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left \
the court call the next witness said the king the next witness was the \
duchess s cook she carried the pepper box in her hand and the people near the \
door began sneezing all at once give your evidence said the king sha n t said \
the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low \
voice your majesty must cross examine this witness well if i must i must the \
king said what are tarts made of pepper mostly said the cook for some minutes \
the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled down again \
the cook had disappeared never mind said the king call the next witness alice \
watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list imagine her surprise \
when he read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice x alice \
s evidence here cried alice she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury box upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay the trial \
cannot proceed said the king until all the jurymen are back in their proper \
places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice what do you \
know about this business the king said to alice nothing whatever said alice \
the king then read from his book rule forty two all persons more than a mile \
high to leave the court i m not a mile high said alice nearly two miles high \
said the queen well i sha n t go at any rate said alice the king turned pale \
and shut his note book hastily consider your verdict he said to the jury in a \
low trembling voice there s more evidence to come yet please your majesty \
said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been \
picked up it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody he \
unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a \
set of verses please your majesty said the knave i didn t write it and they \
can t prove that i did there s no name signed at the end you must have meant \
some mischief or else you d have signed your name like an honest man said the \
king there was a general clapping of hands at this read them he added turning \
to the white rabbit there was dead silence in the court whilst the white \
rabbit read out the verses that s the most important piece of evidence we ve \
heard yet said the king i don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it \
ventured alice if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a world \
of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any let the jury consider their \
verdict no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards stuff and \
nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence first hold your \
tongue said the queen turning purple i won t said alice off with her head the \
queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody moved who cares for you said \
alice she had grown to her full size by this time you re nothing but a pack \
of cards at this the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon \
her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to \
beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of \
her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered \
down from the trees upon her face wake up alice dear said her sister why what \
a long sleep you ve had oh i ve had such a curious dream said alice and she \
told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange \
adventures of hers that you have just been reading about alice got up and ran \
off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had \

       "I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE Alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures \
or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \
\"without pictures or conversations?\" So she was considering in her own mind \
(as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of \
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink \
eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did \
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took \
a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out \
of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was \
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In \
another moment, down went Alice after it! The rabbit-hole went straight on \
like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that \
Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found \
herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Either the well was \
very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went \
down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, \
but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well \
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and \
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one \
of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to \
her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so \
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Down, down, \
down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so \
Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I \
should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of \
milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\" Alice \
felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon \
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit \
hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark \
overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still \
in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went \
Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a \
corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close \
behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be \
seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of \
lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but they \
were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the \
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she \
was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of \
solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first \
idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! \
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, \
it would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came \
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little \
door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, \
and to her great delight, it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it \
led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and \
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she \
longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of \
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a \
telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\" Alice went back to \
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a \
book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a \
little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said Alice), \
and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \
\"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. \"No, I'll look \
first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not,\" for she \
had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is \
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle \
was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it \
very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, \
roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off. * \
* * * * \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like \
a telescope!\" And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and \
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \
going through the little door into that lovely garden. After awhile, finding \
that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; \
but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had \
forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, \
she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with \
trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \"Come, there's no use in \
crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather sharply. \"I advise you to \
leave off this minute!\" She generally gave herself very good advice (though \
she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely \
as to bring tears into her eyes. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that \
was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, \
on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, \
I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the \
key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either \
way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\" She ate a \
little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which way?\" holding \
her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she \
was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to \
work and very soon finished off the cake. II--THE POOL OF TEARS \"Curiouser \
and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment \
she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I'm opening out like the \
largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I \
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\" Just at this \
moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now \
rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden \
key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she \
could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one \
eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began \
to cry again. She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large \
pool all 'round her and reaching half down the hall. After a time, she heard \
a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to \
see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, \
with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He \
came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the \
Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\" \
When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you \
please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves \
and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice \
took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went \
on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday \
things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got up this morning? \
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, \
_that's_ the great puzzle!\" As she said this, she looked down at her hands \
and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white \
kid-gloves while she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she \
thought. \"I must be growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table \
to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and \
was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was \
the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save \
herself from shrinking away altogether. \"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said \
Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find \
herself still in existence. \"And now for the garden!\" And she ran with all \
speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and \
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \"Things are \
worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this \
before, never!\" As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another \
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that \
she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was \
in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. Just \
then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and \
she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a \
mouse that had slipped in like herself. \"Would it be of any use, now,\" \
thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down \
here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no \
harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this \
pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at \
her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little \
eyes, but it said nothing. \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought \
Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the \
Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"O\[CapitalATilde]\.b9 est ma chatte?\" \
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a \
sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, \
I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor \
animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\" \"Not like \
cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like \
cats, if you were me?\" \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \
\"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I \
think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a \
dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it \
must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather \
not.\" \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of \
its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ \
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\" \"I \
won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of \
conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice \
little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats \
and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended \
it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, \
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly \
after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or \
dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned \
'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in \
a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my \
history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\" It was high \
time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals \
that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, \
and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party \
swam to the shore. III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE They were indeed a \
queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled \
feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping \
wet, cross and uncomfortable. The first question, of course, was how to get \
dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it \
seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, \
as if she had known them all her life. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a \
person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and \
listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, \
in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with \
an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. \
Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was \
favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted \
leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. \
Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\" \"Ugh!\" said the \
Lory, with a shiver. \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of \
Canterbury, found it advisable'--\" \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck. \"Found \
_it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' \
means.\" \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said \
the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the \
archbishop find?\" The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went \
on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and \
offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, \
turning to Alice as it spoke. \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy \
tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\" \"In that case,\" said the Dodo \
solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the \
immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\" \"Speak English!\" said the \
Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's \
more, I don't believe you do either!\" \"What I was going to say,\" said the \
Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a \
Caucus-race.\" \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice. \"Why,\" said the \
Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a \
race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along \
the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but \
they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it \
was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called \
out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and \
asking, \"But who has won?\" This question the Dodo could not answer without \
a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ \
must have prizes.\" \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of \
voices asked. \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice \
with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, \
in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\" Alice had no idea what to do, and in \
despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits \
(luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as \
prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round. The next thing was to eat \
the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds \
complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and \
had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down \
again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. \"You \
promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you \
hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be \
offended again. \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to \
Alice and sighing. \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking \
down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she \
kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of \
the tale was something like this:-- \"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in \
the house, 'Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-- Come, I'll \
take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing \
to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or \
judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said \
cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\" \
\"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you \
thinking of?\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got \
to the fifth bend, I think?\" \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" \
said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \"Please come back and finish \
your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \
\"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker. \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This \
caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off \
at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \
\"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various \
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone. \"I wish I hadn't \
mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the \
best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very \
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little \
pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly. IV--THE \
RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back \
again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; \
Alice heard it muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear \
paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are \
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a \
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and \
she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere \
to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and \
the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished \
completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an \
angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\" \"He took me \
for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be \
when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little \
house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. \
RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, \
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the \
house before she had found the fan and gloves. By this time, Alice had found \
her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan \
and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a \
pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell \
upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and \
put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large \
again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\" \
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the \
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put \
down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any \
more.\" Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing \
and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, \
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up \
the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. \
What _will_ become of me?\" Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had \
now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard \
a voice outside and stopped to listen. \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the \
voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Then came a little pattering of \
feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and \
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now \
about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid \
of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as \
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that \
attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll go 'round \
and get in at the window.\" \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after \
waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she \
suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get \
hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of \
broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had \
fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort. Next came an angry \
voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And then a voice she had \
never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\" \
\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the \
window?\" \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\" \"Well, it's got no business \
there, at any rate; go and take it away!\" There was a long silence after \
this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread \
out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were \
_two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll \
do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish \
they _could_!\" She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At \
last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many \
voices all talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other \
ladder? Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to \
go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master \
says you've got to go down the chimney!\" Alice drew her foot as far down the \
chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and \
scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick \
and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a \
general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch \
him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence and then another confusion of \
voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--What happened to \
you?\" Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No \
more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me like a \
Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" After a minute or two of \
silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A \
barrowful will do, to begin with.\" \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. \
But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles \
came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice \
noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little \
cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I \
eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in \
my size.\" So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that \
she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through \
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals \
and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she \
appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in \
a thick wood. \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as \
she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the \
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to \
eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'\" Alice \
looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could \
not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same \
height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the \
edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was \
sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. V--ADVICE FROM A \
CATERPILLAR At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice. \"Who are _you_?\" said the \
Caterpillar. Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at \
present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think \
I must have changed several times since then.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \
said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain yourself!\" \"I can't explain \
_myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm not myself, you \
see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\" She drew \
herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you ought to tell me who _you_ \
are, first.\" \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar. As Alice could not think of any \
good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of \
mind, she turned away. \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \
\"I've something important to say!\" Alice turned and came back again. \"Keep \
your temper,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing \
down her anger as well as she could. \"No,\" said the Caterpillar. It \
unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you \
think you're changed, do you?\" \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I \
can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten \
minutes together!\" \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar. \
\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one \
doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_ \
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a \
wretched height to be.\" \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the \
Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three \
inches high). In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom \
and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side \
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\" \
\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to herself. \
\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; \
and in another moment, it was out of sight. Alice remained looking \
thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the \
two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they \
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. \"And now which is \
which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to \
try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her \
chin--it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very \
sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to \
eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot \
that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and \
managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.... \"Come, my head's free \
at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an \
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of \
green leaves that lay far below her. \"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And \
oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\" She was delighted to find \
that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She \
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to \
dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a \
large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its \
wings. \"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon. \"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice \
indignantly. \"Let me alone!\" \"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've \
tried banks, and I've tried hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those \
serpents! There's no pleasing them!\" Alice was more and more puzzled. \"As \
if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon, \"but I \
must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken \
the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a \
shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they \
must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\" \"But I'm _not_ \
a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a little girl,\" she \
added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone \
through that day. \"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" \
said the Pigeon; \"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl \
or a serpent?\" \"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but \
I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want \
_yours_--I don't like them raw.\" \"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in \
a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down \
among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled \
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. \
After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her \
hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at \
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had \
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since \
she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at \
first. \"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that \
to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open \
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\
\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size; why, I \
should frighten them out of their wits!\" She did not venture to go near the \
house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. VI--PIG AND \
PEPPER For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she \
would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his \
knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and \
large eyes like a frog. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his \
arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn \
tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The \
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An \
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low and \
their curls got entangled together. When Alice next peeped out, the \
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, \
staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door and \
knocked. \"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that \
for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; \
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly \
hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on \
within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great \
crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \"How am I to get \
in?\" asked Alice. \"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's \
the first question, you know.\" Alice opened the door and went in. The door \
led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the \
other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing \
a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which \
seemed to be full of soup. \"There's certainly too much pepper in that \
soup!\" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. Even the \
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and \
howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the \
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was \
grinning from ear to ear. \"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why your cat grins like that?\" \"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the \
Duchess, \"and that's why.\" \"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always \
grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice. \"You \
don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\" Just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came \
first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess \
took no notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so \
much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or \
not. \"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and \
down in an agony of terror. \"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" \
the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go \
and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the \
room. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped \
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I \
don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to kill \
it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She said the \
last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply. \"If you're going \
to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have nothing more to do \
with you. Mind now!\" Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, \
what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted \
again so violently that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This \
time there could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than \
a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it \
trot away quietly into the wood. Alice was a little startled by seeing the \
Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only \
grinned when it saw her. \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \
\"would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?\" \"In _that_ \
direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives a Hatter; and \
in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit \
either you like; they're both mad.\" \"But I don't want to go among mad \
people,\" Alice remarked. \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're \
all mad here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\" \"I should like it \
very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited yet.\" \"You'll see me \
there,\" said the Cat, and vanished. Alice had not gone much farther before \
she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; it was so large a house \
that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the \
left-hand bit of mushroom. VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY There was a table set out \
under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were \
having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep. The table \
was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. \
\"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \"There's \
_plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large \
arm-chair at one end of the table. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on \
hearing this, but all he said was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\" \
\"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she \
added aloud. \"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to \
it?\" said the March Hare. \"Exactly so,\" said Alice. \"Then you should say \
what you mean,\" the March Hare went on. \"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \
\"at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.\" \
\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be \
talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I \
sleep when I breathe!'\" \"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the \
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its \
head impatiently and said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; \
just what I was going to remark myself.\" \"Have you guessed the riddle \
yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \"No, I give it up,\" Alice \
replied. \"What's the answer?\" \"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the \
Hatter. \"Nor I,\" said the March Hare. Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think \
you might do something better with the time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in \
asking riddles that have no answers.\" \"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare \
said to Alice, very earnestly. \"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an \
offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\" \"You mean you can't take _less_,\" \
said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\" At this, \
Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither \
of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once \
or twice; the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse \
into the tea-pot. \"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, \
as she picked her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever \
was at in all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the \
trees had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \
\"I think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went. Once more she found \
herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. Taking the \
little golden key, she unlocked the door that led into the garden. Then she \
set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her \
pocket) till she was about a foot high; then she walked down the little \
passage; and _then_--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among \
the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET \
GROUND A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses \
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily \
painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as she \
stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\" Five and Seven said nothing, \
but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, \
Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one \
in by mistake; and, if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our \
heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she \
comes, to--\" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the \
garden, called out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners \
instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many \
footsteps and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten \
soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the \
ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came \
the royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next \
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the \
White Rabbit. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on \
a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING \
AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all \
stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She \
said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \"My name \
is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely; but she added \
to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!\" \"Can you play \
croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for Alice. \
\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly. \"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen. \"It's--it's \
a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by the White \
Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \"Very,\" said Alice. \
\"Where's the Duchess?\" \"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under \
sentence of execution.\" \"What for?\" said Alice. \"She boxed the Queen's \
ears--\" the Rabbit began. \"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a \
voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling \
up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and \
the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious \
croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls \
were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to \
double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. \
The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all \
the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen \
was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, \"Off with his \
head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute. \"They're \
dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the great wonder \
is that there's anyone left alive!\" She was looking about for some way of \
escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. \"It's the \
Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself; \"now I shall have somebody to talk \
to.\" \"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat. \"I don't think they play at \
all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; \"and they all \
quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to \
have any rules in particular.\" \"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat \
in a low voice. \"Not at all,\" said Alice. Alice thought she might as well \
go back and see how the game was going on. So she went off in search of her \
hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which \
seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the \
other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other \
side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of \
way, to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under \
her arm, that it might not escape again. Just then Alice ran across the \
Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her arm affectionately into \
Alice's and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper. She was a little startled, however, when she heard the \
voice of the Duchess close to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my \
dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\" \"The game's going on rather \
better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. \
\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love, \
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'\" \"Somebody said,\" Alice \
whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding his own business!\" \"Ah, \
well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her sharp \
little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of _that_ \
is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.'\" \
To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers began \
to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them, with \
her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm! \"Now, I give you fair \
warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke, \"either \
you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your \
choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \"Let's go \
on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much \
frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. \
All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with the \
other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" \
By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the King, the Queen \
and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution. \
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with Alice. \
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You are \
all pardoned.\" Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the \
distance, and Alice ran along with the others. IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS? The \
King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with \
a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as \
well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in \
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the \
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the \
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of \
tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" Alice thought, \"and \
hand 'round the refreshments!\" The judge, by the way, was the King and he \
wore his crown over his great wig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \
\"and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I \
suppose they are the jurors.\" Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence \
in the court!\" \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King. On this, the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the \
parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some \
tarts, All on a summer day; The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And \
took them quite away!\" \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First \
witness!\" The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one \
hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. \"You ought to have \
finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\" The Hatter looked at the \
March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the \
Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\" he said. \"Give your \
evidence,\" said the King, \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed \
on the spot.\" This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept \
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in \
his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread \
and butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was \
beginning to grow larger again. The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and \
bread and butter and went down on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" \
he began. \"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King. \"You may go,\" \
said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court. \"Call the next \
witness!\" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She \
carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began \
sneezing all at once. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King. \"Sha'n't,\" \
said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a \
low voice, \"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\" \"Well, if I \
must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\" \"Pepper, \
mostly,\" said the cook. For some minutes the whole court was in confusion \
and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \
\"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\" Alice watched the \
White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read \
out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"Alice!\" X--ALICE'S \
EVIDENCE \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below. \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay. \
\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are back \
in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking \
hard at Alice. \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to \
Alice. \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice. The King then read from his book: \
\"Rule forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\" \
\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice. \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the \
Queen. \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice. The King turned pale \
and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your verdict,\" he said to the \
jury, in a low, trembling voice. \"There's more evidence to come yet, please \
Your Majesty,\" said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This \
paper has just been picked up. It seems to be a letter written by the \
prisoner to--to somebody.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It \
isn't a letter, after all; it's a set of verses.\" \"Please, Your Majesty,\" \
said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; there's \
no name signed at the end.\" \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else \
you'd have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a \
general clapping of hands at this. \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the \
White Rabbit. There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit \
read out the verses. \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've \
heard yet,\" said the King. \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in \
it,\" ventured Alice. \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that \
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the \
jury consider their verdict.\" \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence \
first--verdict afterwards.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The \
idea of having the sentence first!\" \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, \
turning purple. \"I won't!\" said Alice. \"Off with her head!\" the Queen \
shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \"Who cares for _you_?\" said \
Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). \"You're nothing but a \
pack of cards!\" At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying \
down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, \
and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her \
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves \
that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \"Wake up, Alice \
dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've had!\" \"Oh, I've \
had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as \
she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have \
just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as \
well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.", $CellContext`textProc = 
       "i down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or \
conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without \
pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as \
she could for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the \
pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and \
picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by \
her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so \
very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i \
shall be too late but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its \
waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her \
feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit \
with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with \
curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it \
pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went \
alice after it the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way \
and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to \
think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what \
seemed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very \
slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her first \
she tried to make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see \
anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were \
filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and \
pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she \
passed it was labeled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was \
empty she did not like to drop the jar so managed to put it into one of the \
cupboards as she fell past it down down down would the fall never come to an \
end there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking to herself dinah \
ll miss me very much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope they ll \
remember her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down \
here with me alice felt that she was dozing off when suddenly thump thump \
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over \
alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up in a moment she looked up but it \
was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white \
rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost \
away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it \
turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting she was close \
behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen \
she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps \
hanging from the roof there were doors all round the hall but they were all \
locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other \
trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever \
to get out again suddenly she came upon a little table all made of solid \
glass there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alice s first idea \
was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either \
the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would \
not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low \
curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about \
fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her \
great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a \
small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along \
the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out \
of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and \
those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway \
oh said alice how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if \
i only knew how to begin alice went back to the table half hoping she might \
find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up \
like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was \
not here before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper \
label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters no i \
ll look first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not for she had \
never forgotten that if you drink from a bottle marked poison it is almost \
certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not \
marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had a \
sort of mixed flavor of cherry tart custard pineapple roast turkey toffy and \
hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off what a curious feeling said \
alice i must be shutting up like a telescope and so it was indeed she was now \
only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was \
now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden \
after awhile finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the \
garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she \
had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for \
it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying \
the poor little thing sat down and cried come there s no use in crying like \
that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this \
minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom \
followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears \
into her eyes soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under \
the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words \
eat me were beautifully marked in currants well i ll eat it said alice and if \
it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i \
can creep under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i don t \
care which happens she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which \
way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she \
was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same \
size so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake ii the pool of \
tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for \
the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now i m opening out \
like the largest telescope that ever was good by feet oh my poor little feet \
i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears i shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you just at this moment \
her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now rather more \
than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried \
off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down \
on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through \
was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again she went on \
shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her and \
reaching half down the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet \
in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was \
the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves \
in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great \
hurry muttering to himself oh the duchess the duchess oh won t she be savage \
if i ve kept her waiting when the rabbit came near her alice began in a low \
timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white \
kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he \
could go alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all \
the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day and \
yesterday things went on just as usual was i the same when i got up this \
morning but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah \
that s the great puzzle as she said this she looked down at her hands and was \
surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid \
gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be \
growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it \
and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking \
rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding \
and she dropped it hastily just in time to save herself from shrinking away \
altogether that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the \
sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for \
the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the \
little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass \
table as before things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never \
was so small as this before never as she said these words her foot slipped \
and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first \
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea however she soon made out \
that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet \
high just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way \
off and she swam nearer to see what it was she soon made out that it was only \
a mouse that had slipped in like herself would it be of any use now thought \
alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here that i \
should think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in trying so \
she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of \
swimming about here o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and \
seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing perhaps \
it doesn t understand english thought alice i dare say it s a french mouse \
come over with william the conqueror so she began again o\[ATilde] est ma \
chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson book the mouse gave \
a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i \
beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal \
s feelings i quite forgot you didn t like cats not like cats cried the mouse \
in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me well perhaps \
not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it and yet i wish i \
could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could \
only see her she is such a dear quiet thing the mouse was bristling all over \
and she felt certain it must be really offended we won t talk about her any \
more if you d rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to \
the end of its tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always \
hated cats nasty low vulgar things don t let me hear the name again i won t \
indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are \
you are you fond of of dogs there is such a nice little dog near our house i \
should like to show you it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a \
sorrowful tone i m afraid i ve offended it again for the mouse was swimming \
away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool \
as it went so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we \
won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them when the mouse \
heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite \
pale and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i \
ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs \
it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds \
and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and \
an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole \
party swam to the shore iii a caucus race and a long tale they were indeed a \
queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled \
feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping \
wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course was how to get dry \
again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed \
quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she \
had known them all her life at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of \
some authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me i \
ll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with \
the mouse in the middle ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all \
ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william \
the conqueror whose cause was favored by the pope was soon submitted to by \
the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to \
usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria \
ugh said the lory with a shiver and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of \
canterbury found it advisable found what said the duck found it the mouse \
replied rather crossly of course you know what it means i know what it means \
well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a worm \
the question is what did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this \
question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling \
to meet william and offer him the crown how are you getting on now my dear it \
continued turning to alice as it spoke as wet as ever said alice in a \
melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all in that case said the dodo \
solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate \
adoption of more energetic remedies speak english said the eaglet i don t \
know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you \
do either what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone is that \
the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race what is a caucus race \
said alice why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it first it \
marked out a race course in a sort of circle and then all the party were \
placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away \
but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that \
it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called \
out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who \
has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of \
thought at last it said everybody has won and all must have prizes but who is \
to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked why she of course said the \
dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded \
round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes alice had no idea what \
to do and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of \
comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as \
prizes there was exactly one a piece all round the next thing was to eat the \
comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained \
that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be \
patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a \
ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more you promised to tell me \
your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in \
a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again mine is a long and a \
sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing it is a long tail \
certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail but why do \
you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was \
speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a \
mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you \
come i ll take no denial we must have the trial for really this morning i ve \
nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or \
judge would be wasting our breath i ll be judge i ll be jury said cunning old \
fury i ll try the whole cause and condemn you to death you are not attending \
said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of i beg your pardon \
said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think you insult me by \
talking such nonsense said the mouse getting up and walking away please come \
back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in \
chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker i wish i had dinah our cat here said alice this caused a \
remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once \
and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my \
dears it s high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved \
off and alice was soon left alone i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah nobody \
seems to like her down here and i m sure she s the best cat in the world poor \
alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited in a \
little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the \
distance and she looked up eagerly iv the rabbit sends in a little bill it \
was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about \
as it went as if it had lost something alice heard it muttering to itself the \
duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she ll get me \
executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i \
wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair \
of white kid gloves and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them \
but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her \
swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door \
had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice and called to her \
in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now he took me for his \
housemaid said alice as she ran off how surprised he ll be when he finds out \
who i am as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of \
which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she \
went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should \
meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found \
the fan and gloves by this time alice had found her way into a tidy little \
room with a table in the window and on it a fan and two or three pairs of \
tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was \
just going to leave the room when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that \
stood near the looking glass she uncorked it and put it to her lips saying to \
herself i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired \
of being such a tiny little thing before she had drunk half the bottle she \
found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck \
from being broken she hastily put down the bottle remarking that s quite \
enough i hope i sha n t grow any more alas it was too late to wish that she \
went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor \
still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the \
window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more \
whatever happens what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic \
bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger after a few minutes \
she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen mary ann mary ann said the \
voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on \
the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she \
trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a \
thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it \
presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door \
opened inwards and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt \
proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then i ll go round and get in \
at the window that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she fancied \
she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand \
and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a \
little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded \
that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of \
that sort next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat pat where are you and \
then a voice she had never heard before sure then i m here digging for apples \
yer honor here come and help me out of this now tell me pat what s that in \
the window sure it s an arm yer honor well it s got no business there at any \
rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could \
only hear whispers now and then and at last she spread out her hand again and \
made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and \
more sounds of broken glass i wonder what they ll do next thought alice as \
for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could she waited for some \
time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cart \
wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out \
the words where s the other ladder bill s got the other bill here bill will \
the roof bear who s to go down the chimney nay i sha n t you do it here bill \
the master says you ve got to go down the chimney alice drew her foot as far \
down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal \
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then she gave \
one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next the first thing she \
heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit s voice alone \
catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices \
hold up his head brandy now don t choke him what happened to you last came a \
little feeble squeaking voice well i hardly know no more thank ye i m better \
now all i know is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes \
like a sky rocket after a minute or two of silence they began moving about \
again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with a \
barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next \
moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of \
them hit her in the face alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles \
were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea \
came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make \
some change in my size so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to \
find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get \
through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little \
animals and birds waiting outside they all made a rush at alice the moment \
she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe \
in a thick wood the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she \
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second \
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i suppose i ought to eat or \
drink something or other but the great question is what alice looked all \
around her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she could not see \
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same \
height as herself she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge \
and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was \
sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else v advice from a \
caterpillar at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed alice in a languid sleepy voice who are you said the caterpillar \
alice replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present at least i \
know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have changed \
several times since then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar \
sternly explain yourself i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice \
because i m not myself you see being so many different sizes in a day is very \
confusing she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell \
me who you are first why said the caterpillar as alice could not think of any \
good reason and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of \
mind she turned away come back the caterpillar called after her i ve \
something important to say alice turned and came back again keep your temper \
said the caterpillar is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well \
as she could no said the caterpillar it unfolded its arms took the hookah out \
of its mouth again and said so you think you re changed do you i m afraid i \
am sir said alice i can t remember things as i used and i don t keep the same \
size for ten minutes together what size do you want to be asked the \
caterpillar oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one \
doesn t like changing so often you know i should like to be a little larger \
sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to \
be it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing \
itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high in a minute or \
two the caterpillar got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass \
merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other \
side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side of what \
thought alice to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she \
had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained \
looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which \
were the two sides of it at last she stretched her arms round it as far as \
they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is \
which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try \
the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had \
struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change as \
she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other \
bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly \
room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel \
of the left hand bit come my head s free at last said alice but all she could \
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise \
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her where have \
my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i can t see you she was \
delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like \
a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag \
and was going to dive in among the leaves when a sharp hiss made her draw \
back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her \
violently with its wings serpent cried the pigeon i m not a serpent said \
alice indignantly let me alone i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried \
banks and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on but those serpents there s no \
pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled as if it wasn t trouble enough \
hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents \
night and day and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continued \
the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should \
be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh \
serpent but i m not a serpent i tell you said alice i m a i m a i m a little \
girl she added rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she \
had gone through that day you re looking for eggs i know that well enough \
said the pigeon and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or \
a serpent it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m not looking \
for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn t want yours i don t like them \
raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again \
into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for \
her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she \
had to stop and untwist it after awhile she remembered that she still held \
the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully \
nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and \
sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her \
usual height it was so long since she had been anything near the right size \
that it felt quite strange at first the next thing is to get into that \
beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came \
suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high \
whoever lives there thought alice it ll never do to come upon them this size \
why i should frighten them out of their wits she did not venture to go near \
the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high vi pig and \
pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood judging by his face only she \
would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles \
it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes \
like a frog the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great \
letter and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the \
duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman \
repeated in the same solemn tone from the queen an invitation for the duchess \
to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled \
together when alice next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other \
was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky \
alice went timidly up to the door and knocked there s no sort of use in \
knocking said the footman and that for two reasons first because i m on the \
same side of the door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise \
inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most \
extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every \
now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces \
how am i to get in asked alice are you to get in at all said the footman that \
s the first question you know alice opened the door and went in the door led \
right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other \
the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby \
the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large caldron which seemed to \
be full of soup there s certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to \
herself as well as she could for sneezing even the duchess sneezed \
occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately \
without a moment s pause the only two creatures in the kitchen that did not \
sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was grinning from ear to ear \
please would you tell me said alice a little timidly why your cat grins like \
that it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why i didn t know that \
cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didn t know that cats could grin said \
alice you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came \
first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took \
no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much \
already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not \
oh please mind what you re doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony \
of terror here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice \
flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet \
with the queen and she hurried out of the room alice caught the baby with \
some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its \
arms and legs in all directions if i don t take this child away with me \
thought alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder \
to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing \
grunted in reply if you re going to turn into a pig my dear said alice i ll \
have nothing more to do with you mind now alice was just beginning to think \
to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it \
grunted again so violently that alice looked down into its face in some alarm \
this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less \
than a pig so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see \
it trot away quietly into the wood alice was a little startled by seeing the \
cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only \
grinned when it saw her cheshire puss began alice rather timidly would you \
please tell me which way i ought to go from here in that direction the cat \
said waving the right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving \
the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like they re both mad but i \
don t want to go among mad people alice remarked oh you can t help that said \
the cat we re all mad here do you play croquet with the queen to day i should \
like it very much said alice but i haven t been invited yet you ll see me \
there said the cat and vanished alice had not gone much farther before she \
came in sight of the house of the march hare it was so large a house that she \
did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the left hand bit \
of mushroom vii a mad tea party there was a table set out under a tree in \
front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a \
dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep the table was a large one but \
the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they \
cried out when they saw alice coming there s plenty of room said alice \
indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table the \
hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a \
raven like a writing desk i m glad they ve begun asking riddles i believe i \
can guess that she added aloud do you mean that you think you can find out \
the answer to it said the march hare exactly so said alice then you should \
say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hastily replied at least \
at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know you might just as \
well say added the dormouse which seemed to be talking in its sleep that i \
breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe it is the \
same thing with you said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its \
nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its \
eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself have you \
guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again no i give it up \
alice replied what s the answer i haven t the slightest idea said the hatter \
nor i said the march hare alice gave a weary sigh i think you might do \
something better with the time she said than wasting it in asking riddles \
that have no answers take some more tea the march hare said to alice very \
earnestly i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can t \
take more you mean you can t take less said the hatter it s very easy to take \
more than nothing at this alice got up and walked off the dormouse fell \
asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going \
though she looked back once or twice the last time she saw them they were \
trying to put the dormouse into the tea pot at any rate i ll never go there \
again said alice as she picked her way through the wood it s the stupidest \
tea party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that \
one of the trees had a door leading right into it that s very curious she \
thought i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she \
found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table taking the \
little golden key she unlocked the door that led into the garden then she set \
to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket \
till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and \
then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright \
flower beds and the cool fountains viii the queen s croquet ground a large \
rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were \
white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red suddenly \
their eyes chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them would you \
tell me please said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses \
five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why \
the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we \
put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should \
all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss we re doing our best \
afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across \
the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly \
threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps \
and alice looked round eager to see the queen first came ten soldiers \
carrying clubs with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten \
courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds after these came the \
royal children there were ten of them all ornamented with hearts next came \
the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognized the white \
rabbit then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king s crown on a \
crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king \
and the queen of hearts when the procession came opposite to alice they all \
stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it \
to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply my name is alice so \
please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why \
they re only a pack of cards after all can you play croquet shouted the queen \
the question was evidently meant for alice yes said alice loudly come on then \
roared the queen it s it s a very fine day said a timid voice to alice she \
was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face very \
said alice where s the duchess hush hush said the rabbit she s under sentence \
of execution what for said alice she boxed the queen s ears the rabbit began \
get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began \
running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they \
got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had \
never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and \
furrows the croquet balls were live hedgehogs and the mallets live flamingos \
and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and \
feet to make the arches the players all played at once without waiting for \
turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very \
short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and \
shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute they \
re dreadfully fond of beheading people here thought alice the great wonder is \
that there s anyone left alive she was looking about for some way of escape \
when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it s the cheshire cat she \
said to herself now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on \
said the cat i don t think they play at all fairly alice said in a rather \
complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself \
speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular how do you like the \
queen said the cat in a low voice not at all said alice alice thought she \
might as well go back and see how the game was going on so she went off in \
search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another \
hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of \
them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across \
to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless \
sort of way to fly up into a tree she caught the flamingo and tucked it away \
under her arm that it might not escape again just then alice ran across the \
duchess who was now out of prison she tucked her arm affectionately into \
alice s and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper she was a little startled however when she heard the voice \
of the duchess close to her ear you re thinking about something my dear and \
that makes you forget to talk the game s going on rather better now alice \
said by way of keeping up the conversation a little tis so said the duchess \
and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round \
somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding his own \
business ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her \
sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is \
take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves to alice s \
great surprise the duchess s arm that was linked into hers began to tremble \
alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms \
folded frowning like a thunderstorm now i give you fair warning shouted the \
queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off \
and that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice \
and was gone in a moment let s go on with the game the queen said to alice \
and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back \
to the croquet ground all the time they were playing the queen never left off \
quarreling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with \
her head by the end of half an hour or so all the players except the king the \
queen and alice were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of \
execution then the queen left off quite out of breath and walked away with \
alice alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you \
are all pardoned suddenly the cry the trial s beginning was heard in the \
distance and alice ran along with the others ix who stole the tarts the king \
and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a \
great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well \
as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with \
a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit \
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very \
middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it i wish \
they d get the trial done alice thought and hand round the refreshments the \
judge by the way was the king and he wore his crown over his great wig that s \
the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures some were animals and \
some were birds i suppose they are the jurors just then the white rabbit \
cried out silence in the court herald read the accusation said the king on \
this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet then unrolled the \
parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts \
all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them \
quite away call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew \
three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness the first witness \
was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and \
butter in the other you ought to have finished said the king when did you \
begin the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court \
arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it was he said give \
your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on \
the spot this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting \
from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion \
he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter just \
at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation she was beginning to grow \
larger again the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and \
went down on one knee i m a poor man your majesty he began you re a very poor \
speaker said the king you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left \
the court call the next witness said the king the next witness was the \
duchess s cook she carried the pepper box in her hand and the people near the \
door began sneezing all at once give your evidence said the king sha n t said \
the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low \
voice your majesty must cross examine this witness well if i must i must the \
king said what are tarts made of pepper mostly said the cook for some minutes \
the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled down again \
the cook had disappeared never mind said the king call the next witness alice \
watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list imagine her surprise \
when he read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice x alice \
s evidence here cried alice she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury box upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay the trial \
cannot proceed said the king until all the jurymen are back in their proper \
places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice what do you \
know about this business the king said to alice nothing whatever said alice \
the king then read from his book rule forty two all persons more than a mile \
high to leave the court i m not a mile high said alice nearly two miles high \
said the queen well i sha n t go at any rate said alice the king turned pale \
and shut his note book hastily consider your verdict he said to the jury in a \
low trembling voice there s more evidence to come yet please your majesty \
said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been \
picked up it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody he \
unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a \
set of verses please your majesty said the knave i didn t write it and they \
can t prove that i did there s no name signed at the end you must have meant \
some mischief or else you d have signed your name like an honest man said the \
king there was a general clapping of hands at this read them he added turning \
to the white rabbit there was dead silence in the court whilst the white \
rabbit read out the verses that s the most important piece of evidence we ve \
heard yet said the king i don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it \
ventured alice if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a world \
of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any let the jury consider their \
verdict no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards stuff and \
nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence first hold your \
tongue said the queen turning purple i won t said alice off with her head the \
queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody moved who cares for you said \
alice she had grown to her full size by this time you re nothing but a pack \
of cards at this the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon \
her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to \
beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of \
her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered \
down from the trees upon her face wake up alice dear said her sister why what \
a long sleep you ve had oh i ve had such a curious dream said alice and she \
told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange \
adventures of hers that you have just been reading about alice got up and ran \
off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had \

       "I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE Alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures \
or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \
\"without pictures or conversations?\" So she was considering in her own mind \
(as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of \
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink \
eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did \
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took \
a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out \
of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was \
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In \
another moment, down went Alice after it! The rabbit-hole went straight on \
like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that \
Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found \
herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Either the well was \
very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went \
down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, \
but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well \
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and \
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one \
of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to \
her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so \
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Down, down, \
down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so \
Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I \
should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of \
milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\" Alice \
felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon \
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit \
hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark \
overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still \
in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went \
Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a \
corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close \
behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be \
seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of \
lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but they \
were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the \
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she \
was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of \
solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first \
idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! \
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, \
it would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came \
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little \
door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, \
and to her great delight, it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it \
led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and \
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she \
longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of \
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a \
telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\" Alice went back to \
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a \
book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a \
little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said Alice), \
and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \
\"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. \"No, I'll look \
first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not,\" for she \
had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is \
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle \
was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it \
very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, \
roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off. * \
* * * * \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like \
a telescope!\" And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and \
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \
going through the little door into that lovely garden. After awhile, finding \
that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; \
but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had \
forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, \
she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with \
trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \"Come, there's no use in \
crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather sharply. \"I advise you to \
leave off this minute!\" She generally gave herself very good advice (though \
she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely \
as to bring tears into her eyes. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that \
was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, \
on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, \
I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the \
key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either \
way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\" She ate a \
little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which way?\" holding \
her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she \
was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to \
work and very soon finished off the cake. II--THE POOL OF TEARS \"Curiouser \
and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment \
she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I'm opening out like the \
largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I \
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\" Just at this \
moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now \
rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden \
key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she \
could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one \
eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began \
to cry again. She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large \
pool all 'round her and reaching half down the hall. After a time, she heard \
a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to \
see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, \
with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He \
came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the \
Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\" \
When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you \
please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves \
and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice \
took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went \
on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday \
things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got up this morning? \
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, \
_that's_ the great puzzle!\" As she said this, she looked down at her hands \
and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white \
kid-gloves while she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she \
thought. \"I must be growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table \
to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and \
was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was \
the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save \
herself from shrinking away altogether. \"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said \
Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find \
herself still in existence. \"And now for the garden!\" And she ran with all \
speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and \
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \"Things are \
worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this \
before, never!\" As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another \
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that \
she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was \
in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. Just \
then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and \
she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a \
mouse that had slipped in like herself. \"Would it be of any use, now,\" \
thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down \
here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no \
harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this \
pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at \
her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little \
eyes, but it said nothing. \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought \
Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the \
Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"O\[CapitalATilde]\.b9 est ma chatte?\" \
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a \
sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, \
I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor \
animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\" \"Not like \
cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like \
cats, if you were me?\" \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \
\"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I \
think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a \
dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it \
must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather \
not.\" \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of \
its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ \
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\" \"I \
won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of \
conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice \
little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats \
and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended \
it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, \
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly \
after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or \
dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned \
'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in \
a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my \
history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\" It was high \
time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals \
that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, \
and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party \
swam to the shore. III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE They were indeed a \
queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled \
feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping \
wet, cross and uncomfortable. The first question, of course, was how to get \
dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it \
seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, \
as if she had known them all her life. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a \
person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and \
listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, \
in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with \
an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. \
Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was \
favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted \
leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. \
Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\" \"Ugh!\" said the \
Lory, with a shiver. \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of \
Canterbury, found it advisable'--\" \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck. \"Found \
_it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' \
means.\" \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said \
the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the \
archbishop find?\" The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went \
on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and \
offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, \
turning to Alice as it spoke. \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy \
tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\" \"In that case,\" said the Dodo \
solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the \
immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\" \"Speak English!\" said the \
Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's \
more, I don't believe you do either!\" \"What I was going to say,\" said the \
Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a \
Caucus-race.\" \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice. \"Why,\" said the \
Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a \
race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along \
the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but \
they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it \
was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called \
out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and \
asking, \"But who has won?\" This question the Dodo could not answer without \
a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ \
must have prizes.\" \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of \
voices asked. \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice \
with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, \
in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\" Alice had no idea what to do, and in \
despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits \
(luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as \
prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round. The next thing was to eat \
the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds \
complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and \
had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down \
again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. \"You \
promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you \
hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be \
offended again. \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to \
Alice and sighing. \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking \
down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she \
kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of \
the tale was something like this:-- \"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in \
the house, 'Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-- Come, I'll \
take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing \
to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or \
judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said \
cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\" \
\"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you \
thinking of?\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got \
to the fifth bend, I think?\" \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" \
said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \"Please come back and finish \
your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \
\"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker. \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This \
caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off \
at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \
\"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various \
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone. \"I wish I hadn't \
mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the \
best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very \
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little \
pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly. IV--THE \
RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back \
again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; \
Alice heard it muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear \
paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are \
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a \
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and \
she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere \
to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and \
the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished \
completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an \
angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\" \"He took me \
for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be \
when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little \
house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. \
RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, \
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the \
house before she had found the fan and gloves. By this time, Alice had found \
her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan \
and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a \
pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell \
upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and \
put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large \
again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\" \
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the \
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put \
down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any \
more.\" Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing \
and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, \
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up \
the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. \
What _will_ become of me?\" Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had \
now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard \
a voice outside and stopped to listen. \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the \
voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Then came a little pattering of \
feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and \
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now \
about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid \
of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as \
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that \
attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll go 'round \
and get in at the window.\" \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after \
waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she \
suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get \
hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of \
broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had \
fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort. Next came an angry \
voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And then a voice she had \
never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\" \
\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the \
window?\" \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\" \"Well, it's got no business \
there, at any rate; go and take it away!\" There was a long silence after \
this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread \
out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were \
_two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll \
do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish \
they _could_!\" She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At \
last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many \
voices all talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other \
ladder? Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to \
go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master \
says you've got to go down the chimney!\" Alice drew her foot as far down the \
chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and \
scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick \
and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a \
general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch \
him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence and then another confusion of \
voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--What happened to \
you?\" Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No \
more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me like a \
Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" After a minute or two of \
silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A \
barrowful will do, to begin with.\" \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. \
But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles \
came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice \
noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little \
cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I \
eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in \
my size.\" So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that \
she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through \
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals \
and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she \
appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in \
a thick wood. \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as \
she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the \
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to \
eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'\" Alice \
looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could \
not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same \
height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the \
edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was \
sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. V--ADVICE FROM A \
CATERPILLAR At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice. \"Who are _you_?\" said the \
Caterpillar. Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at \
present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think \
I must have changed several times since then.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \
said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain yourself!\" \"I can't explain \
_myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm not myself, you \
see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\" She drew \
herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you ought to tell me who _you_ \
are, first.\" \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar. As Alice could not think of any \
good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of \
mind, she turned away. \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \
\"I've something important to say!\" Alice turned and came back again. \"Keep \
your temper,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing \
down her anger as well as she could. \"No,\" said the Caterpillar. It \
unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you \
think you're changed, do you?\" \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I \
can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten \
minutes together!\" \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar. \
\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one \
doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_ \
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a \
wretched height to be.\" \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the \
Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three \
inches high). In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom \
and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side \
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\" \
\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to herself. \
\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; \
and in another moment, it was out of sight. Alice remained looking \
thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the \
two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they \
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. \"And now which is \
which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to \
try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her \
chin--it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very \
sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to \
eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot \
that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and \
managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.... \"Come, my head's free \
at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an \
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of \
green leaves that lay far below her. \"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And \
oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\" She was delighted to find \
that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She \
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to \
dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a \
large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its \
wings. \"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon. \"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice \
indignantly. \"Let me alone!\" \"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've \
tried banks, and I've tried hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those \
serpents! There's no pleasing them!\" Alice was more and more puzzled. \"As \
if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon, \"but I \
must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken \
the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a \
shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they \
must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\" \"But I'm _not_ \
a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a little girl,\" she \
added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone \
through that day. \"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" \
said the Pigeon; \"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl \
or a serpent?\" \"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but \
I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want \
_yours_--I don't like them raw.\" \"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in \
a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down \
among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled \
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. \
After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her \
hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at \
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had \
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since \
she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at \
first. \"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that \
to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open \
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\
\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size; why, I \
should frighten them out of their wits!\" She did not venture to go near the \
house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. VI--PIG AND \
PEPPER For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she \
would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his \
knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and \
large eyes like a frog. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his \
arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn \
tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The \
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An \
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low and \
their curls got entangled together. When Alice next peeped out, the \
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, \
staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door and \
knocked. \"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that \
for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; \
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly \
hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on \
within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great \
crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \"How am I to get \
in?\" asked Alice. \"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's \
the first question, you know.\" Alice opened the door and went in. The door \
led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the \
other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing \
a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which \
seemed to be full of soup. \"There's certainly too much pepper in that \
soup!\" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. Even the \
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and \
howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the \
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was \
grinning from ear to ear. \"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why your cat grins like that?\" \"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the \
Duchess, \"and that's why.\" \"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always \
grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice. \"You \
don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\" Just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came \
first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess \
took no notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so \
much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or \
not. \"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and \
down in an agony of terror. \"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" \
the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go \
and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the \
room. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped \
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I \
don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to kill \
it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She said the \
last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply. \"If you're going \
to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have nothing more to do \
with you. Mind now!\" Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, \
what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted \
again so violently that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This \
time there could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than \
a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it \
trot away quietly into the wood. Alice was a little startled by seeing the \
Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only \
grinned when it saw her. \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \
\"would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?\" \"In _that_ \
direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives a Hatter; and \
in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit \
either you like; they're both mad.\" \"But I don't want to go among mad \
people,\" Alice remarked. \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're \
all mad here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\" \"I should like it \
very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited yet.\" \"You'll see me \
there,\" said the Cat, and vanished. Alice had not gone much farther before \
she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; it was so large a house \
that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the \
left-hand bit of mushroom. VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY There was a table set out \
under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were \
having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep. The table \
was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. \
\"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \"There's \
_plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large \
arm-chair at one end of the table. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on \
hearing this, but all he said was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\" \
\"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she \
added aloud. \"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to \
it?\" said the March Hare. \"Exactly so,\" said Alice. \"Then you should say \
what you mean,\" the March Hare went on. \"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \
\"at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.\" \
\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be \
talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I \
sleep when I breathe!'\" \"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the \
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its \
head impatiently and said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; \
just what I was going to remark myself.\" \"Have you guessed the riddle \
yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \"No, I give it up,\" Alice \
replied. \"What's the answer?\" \"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the \
Hatter. \"Nor I,\" said the March Hare. Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think \
you might do something better with the time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in \
asking riddles that have no answers.\" \"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare \
said to Alice, very earnestly. \"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an \
offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\" \"You mean you can't take _less_,\" \
said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\" At this, \
Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither \
of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once \
or twice; the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse \
into the tea-pot. \"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, \
as she picked her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever \
was at in all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the \
trees had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \
\"I think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went. Once more she found \
herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. Taking the \
little golden key, she unlocked the door that led into the garden. Then she \
set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her \
pocket) till she was about a foot high; then she walked down the little \
passage; and _then_--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among \
the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET \
GROUND A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses \
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily \
painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as she \
stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\" Five and Seven said nothing, \
but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, \
Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one \
in by mistake; and, if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our \
heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she \
comes, to--\" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the \
garden, called out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners \
instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many \
footsteps and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten \
soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the \
ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came \
the royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next \
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the \
White Rabbit. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on \
a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING \
AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all \
stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She \
said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \"My name \
is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely; but she added \
to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!\" \"Can you play \
croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for Alice. \
\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly. \"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen. \"It's--it's \
a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by the White \
Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \"Very,\" said Alice. \
\"Where's the Duchess?\" \"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under \
sentence of execution.\" \"What for?\" said Alice. \"She boxed the Queen's \
ears--\" the Rabbit began. \"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a \
voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling \
up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and \
the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious \
croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls \
were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to \
double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. \
The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all \
the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen \
was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, \"Off with his \
head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute. \"They're \
dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the great wonder \
is that there's anyone left alive!\" She was looking about for some way of \
escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. \"It's the \
Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself; \"now I shall have somebody to talk \
to.\" \"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat. \"I don't think they play at \
all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; \"and they all \
quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to \
have any rules in particular.\" \"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat \
in a low voice. \"Not at all,\" said Alice. Alice thought she might as well \
go back and see how the game was going on. So she went off in search of her \
hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which \
seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the \
other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other \
side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of \
way, to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under \
her arm, that it might not escape again. Just then Alice ran across the \
Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her arm affectionately into \
Alice's and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper. She was a little startled, however, when she heard the \
voice of the Duchess close to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my \
dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\" \"The game's going on rather \
better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. \
\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love, \
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'\" \"Somebody said,\" Alice \
whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding his own business!\" \"Ah, \
well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her sharp \
little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of _that_ \
is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.'\" \
To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers began \
to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them, with \
her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm! \"Now, I give you fair \
warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke, \"either \
you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your \
choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \"Let's go \
on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much \
frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. \
All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with the \
other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" \
By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the King, the Queen \
and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution. \
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with Alice. \
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You are \
all pardoned.\" Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the \
distance, and Alice ran along with the others. IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS? The \
King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with \
a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as \
well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in \
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the \
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the \
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of \
tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" Alice thought, \"and \
hand 'round the refreshments!\" The judge, by the way, was the King and he \
wore his crown over his great wig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \
\"and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I \
suppose they are the jurors.\" Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence \
in the court!\" \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King. On this, the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the \
parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some \
tarts, All on a summer day; The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And \
took them quite away!\" \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First \
witness!\" The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one \
hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. \"You ought to have \
finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\" The Hatter looked at the \
March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the \
Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\" he said. \"Give your \
evidence,\" said the King, \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed \
on the spot.\" This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept \
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in \
his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread \
and butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was \
beginning to grow larger again. The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and \
bread and butter and went down on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" \
he began. \"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King. \"You may go,\" \
said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court. \"Call the next \
witness!\" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She \
carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began \
sneezing all at once. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King. \"Sha'n't,\" \
said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a \
low voice, \"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\" \"Well, if I \
must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\" \"Pepper, \
mostly,\" said the cook. For some minutes the whole court was in confusion \
and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \
\"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\" Alice watched the \
White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read \
out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"Alice!\" X--ALICE'S \
EVIDENCE \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below. \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay. \
\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are back \
in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking \
hard at Alice. \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to \
Alice. \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice. The King then read from his book: \
\"Rule forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\" \
\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice. \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the \
Queen. \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice. The King turned pale \
and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your verdict,\" he said to the \
jury, in a low, trembling voice. \"There's more evidence to come yet, please \
Your Majesty,\" said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This \
paper has just been picked up. It seems to be a letter written by the \
prisoner to--to somebody.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It \
isn't a letter, after all; it's a set of verses.\" \"Please, Your Majesty,\" \
said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; there's \
no name signed at the end.\" \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else \
you'd have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a \
general clapping of hands at this. \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the \
White Rabbit. There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit \
read out the verses. \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've \
heard yet,\" said the King. \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in \
it,\" ventured Alice. \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that \
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the \
jury consider their verdict.\" \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence \
first--verdict afterwards.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The \
idea of having the sentence first!\" \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, \
turning purple. \"I won't!\" said Alice. \"Off with her head!\" the Queen \
shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \"Who cares for _you_?\" said \
Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). \"You're nothing but a \
pack of cards!\" At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying \
down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, \
and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her \
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves \
that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \"Wake up, Alice \
dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've had!\" \"Oh, I've \
had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as \
she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have \
just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as \
well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.", $CellContext`textProc = 
       "i down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or \
conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without \
pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as \
she could for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the \
pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and \
picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by \
her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so \
very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i \
shall be too late but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its \
waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her \
feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit \
with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with \
curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it \
pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went \
alice after it the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way \
and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to \
think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what \
seemed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very \
slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her first \
she tried to make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see \
anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were \
filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and \
pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she \
passed it was labeled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was \
empty she did not like to drop the jar so managed to put it into one of the \
cupboards as she fell past it down down down would the fall never come to an \
end there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking to herself dinah \
ll miss me very much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope they ll \
remember her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down \
here with me alice felt that she was dozing off when suddenly thump thump \
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over \
alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up in a moment she looked up but it \
was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white \
rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost \
away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it \
turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting she was close \
behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen \
she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps \
hanging from the roof there were doors all round the hall but they were all \
locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other \
trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever \
to get out again suddenly she came upon a little table all made of solid \
glass there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alice s first idea \
was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either \
the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would \
not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low \
curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about \
fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her \
great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a \
small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along \
the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out \
of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and \
those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway \
oh said alice how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if \
i only knew how to begin alice went back to the table half hoping she might \
find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up \
like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was \
not here before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper \
label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters no i \
ll look first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not for she had \
never forgotten that if you drink from a bottle marked poison it is almost \
certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not \
marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had a \
sort of mixed flavor of cherry tart custard pineapple roast turkey toffy and \
hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off what a curious feeling said \
alice i must be shutting up like a telescope and so it was indeed she was now \
only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was \
now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden \
after awhile finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the \
garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she \
had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for \
it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying \
the poor little thing sat down and cried come there s no use in crying like \
that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this \
minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom \
followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears \
into her eyes soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under \
the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words \
eat me were beautifully marked in currants well i ll eat it said alice and if \
it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i \
can creep under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i don t \
care which happens she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which \
way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she \
was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same \
size so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake ii the pool of \
tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for \
the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now i m opening out \
like the largest telescope that ever was good by feet oh my poor little feet \
i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears i shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you just at this moment \
her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now rather more \
than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried \
off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down \
on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through \
was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again she went on \
shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her and \
reaching half down the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet \
in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was \
the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves \
in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great \
hurry muttering to himself oh the duchess the duchess oh won t she be savage \
if i ve kept her waiting when the rabbit came near her alice began in a low \
timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white \
kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he \
could go alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all \
the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day and \
yesterday things went on just as usual was i the same when i got up this \
morning but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah \
that s the great puzzle as she said this she looked down at her hands and was \
surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid \
gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be \
growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it \
and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking \
rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding \
and she dropped it hastily just in time to save herself from shrinking away \
altogether that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the \
sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for \
the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the \
little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass \
table as before things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never \
was so small as this before never as she said these words her foot slipped \
and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first \
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea however she soon made out \
that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet \
high just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way \
off and she swam nearer to see what it was she soon made out that it was only \
a mouse that had slipped in like herself would it be of any use now thought \
alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here that i \
should think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in trying so \
she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of \
swimming about here o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and \
seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing perhaps \
it doesn t understand english thought alice i dare say it s a french mouse \
come over with william the conqueror so she began again o\[ATilde] est ma \
chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson book the mouse gave \
a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i \
beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal \
s feelings i quite forgot you didn t like cats not like cats cried the mouse \
in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me well perhaps \
not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it and yet i wish i \
could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could \
only see her she is such a dear quiet thing the mouse was bristling all over \
and she felt certain it must be really offended we won t talk about her any \
more if you d rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to \
the end of its tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always \
hated cats nasty low vulgar things don t let me hear the name again i won t \
indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are \
you are you fond of of dogs there is such a nice little dog near our house i \
should like to show you it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a \
sorrowful tone i m afraid i ve offended it again for the mouse was swimming \
away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool \
as it went so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we \
won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them when the mouse \
heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite \
pale and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i \
ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs \
it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds \
and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and \
an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole \
party swam to the shore iii a caucus race and a long tale they were indeed a \
queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled \
feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping \
wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course was how to get dry \
again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed \
quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she \
had known them all her life at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of \
some authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me i \
ll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with \
the mouse in the middle ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all \
ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william \
the conqueror whose cause was favored by the pope was soon submitted to by \
the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to \
usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria \
ugh said the lory with a shiver and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of \
canterbury found it advisable found what said the duck found it the mouse \
replied rather crossly of course you know what it means i know what it means \
well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a worm \
the question is what did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this \
question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling \
to meet william and offer him the crown how are you getting on now my dear it \
continued turning to alice as it spoke as wet as ever said alice in a \
melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all in that case said the dodo \
solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate \
adoption of more energetic remedies speak english said the eaglet i don t \
know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you \
do either what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone is that \
the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race what is a caucus race \
said alice why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it first it \
marked out a race course in a sort of circle and then all the party were \
placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away \
but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that \
it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called \
out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who \
has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of \
thought at last it said everybody has won and all must have prizes but who is \
to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked why she of course said the \
dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded \
round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes alice had no idea what \
to do and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of \
comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as \
prizes there was exactly one a piece all round the next thing was to eat the \
comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained \
that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be \
patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a \
ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more you promised to tell me \
your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in \
a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again mine is a long and a \
sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing it is a long tail \
certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail but why do \
you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was \
speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a \
mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you \
come i ll take no denial we must have the trial for really this morning i ve \
nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or \
judge would be wasting our breath i ll be judge i ll be jury said cunning old \
fury i ll try the whole cause and condemn you to death you are not attending \
said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of i beg your pardon \
said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think you insult me by \
talking such nonsense said the mouse getting up and walking away please come \
back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in \
chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker i wish i had dinah our cat here said alice this caused a \
remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once \
and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my \
dears it s high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved \
off and alice was soon left alone i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah nobody \
seems to like her down here and i m sure she s the best cat in the world poor \
alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited in a \
little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the \
distance and she looked up eagerly iv the rabbit sends in a little bill it \
was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about \
as it went as if it had lost something alice heard it muttering to itself the \
duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she ll get me \
executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i \
wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair \
of white kid gloves and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them \
but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her \
swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door \
had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice and called to her \
in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now he took me for his \
housemaid said alice as she ran off how surprised he ll be when he finds out \
who i am as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of \
which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she \
went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should \
meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found \
the fan and gloves by this time alice had found her way into a tidy little \
room with a table in the window and on it a fan and two or three pairs of \
tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was \
just going to leave the room when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that \
stood near the looking glass she uncorked it and put it to her lips saying to \
herself i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired \
of being such a tiny little thing before she had drunk half the bottle she \
found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck \
from being broken she hastily put down the bottle remarking that s quite \
enough i hope i sha n t grow any more alas it was too late to wish that she \
went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor \
still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the \
window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more \
whatever happens what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic \
bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger after a few minutes \
she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen mary ann mary ann said the \
voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on \
the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she \
trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a \
thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it \
presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door \
opened inwards and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt \
proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then i ll go round and get in \
at the window that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she fancied \
she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand \
and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a \
little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded \
that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of \
that sort next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat pat where are you and \
then a voice she had never heard before sure then i m here digging for apples \
yer honor here come and help me out of this now tell me pat what s that in \
the window sure it s an arm yer honor well it s got no business there at any \
rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could \
only hear whispers now and then and at last she spread out her hand again and \
made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and \
more sounds of broken glass i wonder what they ll do next thought alice as \
for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could she waited for some \
time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cart \
wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out \
the words where s the other ladder bill s got the other bill here bill will \
the roof bear who s to go down the chimney nay i sha n t you do it here bill \
the master says you ve got to go down the chimney alice drew her foot as far \
down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal \
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then she gave \
one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next the first thing she \
heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit s voice alone \
catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices \
hold up his head brandy now don t choke him what happened to you last came a \
little feeble squeaking voice well i hardly know no more thank ye i m better \
now all i know is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes \
like a sky rocket after a minute or two of silence they began moving about \
again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with a \
barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next \
moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of \
them hit her in the face alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles \
were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea \
came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make \
some change in my size so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to \
find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get \
through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little \
animals and birds waiting outside they all made a rush at alice the moment \
she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe \
in a thick wood the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she \
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second \
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i suppose i ought to eat or \
drink something or other but the great question is what alice looked all \
around her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she could not see \
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same \
height as herself she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge \
and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was \
sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else v advice from a \
caterpillar at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed alice in a languid sleepy voice who are you said the caterpillar \
alice replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present at least i \
know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have changed \
several times since then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar \
sternly explain yourself i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice \
because i m not myself you see being so many different sizes in a day is very \
confusing she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell \
me who you are first why said the caterpillar as alice could not think of any \
good reason and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of \
mind she turned away come back the caterpillar called after her i ve \
something important to say alice turned and came back again keep your temper \
said the caterpillar is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well \
as she could no said the caterpillar it unfolded its arms took the hookah out \
of its mouth again and said so you think you re changed do you i m afraid i \
am sir said alice i can t remember things as i used and i don t keep the same \
size for ten minutes together what size do you want to be asked the \
caterpillar oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one \
doesn t like changing so often you know i should like to be a little larger \
sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to \
be it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing \
itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high in a minute or \
two the caterpillar got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass \
merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other \
side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side of what \
thought alice to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she \
had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained \
looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which \
were the two sides of it at last she stretched her arms round it as far as \
they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is \
which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try \
the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had \
struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change as \
she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other \
bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly \
room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel \
of the left hand bit come my head s free at last said alice but all she could \
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise \
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her where have \
my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i can t see you she was \
delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like \
a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag \
and was going to dive in among the leaves when a sharp hiss made her draw \
back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her \
violently with its wings serpent cried the pigeon i m not a serpent said \
alice indignantly let me alone i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried \
banks and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on but those serpents there s no \
pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled as if it wasn t trouble enough \
hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents \
night and day and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continued \
the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should \
be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh \
serpent but i m not a serpent i tell you said alice i m a i m a i m a little \
girl she added rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she \
had gone through that day you re looking for eggs i know that well enough \
said the pigeon and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or \
a serpent it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m not looking \
for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn t want yours i don t like them \
raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again \
into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for \
her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she \
had to stop and untwist it after awhile she remembered that she still held \
the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully \
nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and \
sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her \
usual height it was so long since she had been anything near the right size \
that it felt quite strange at first the next thing is to get into that \
beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came \
suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high \
whoever lives there thought alice it ll never do to come upon them this size \
why i should frighten them out of their wits she did not venture to go near \
the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high vi pig and \
pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood judging by his face only she \
would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles \
it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes \
like a frog the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great \
letter and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the \
duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman \
repeated in the same solemn tone from the queen an invitation for the duchess \
to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled \
together when alice next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other \
was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky \
alice went timidly up to the door and knocked there s no sort of use in \
knocking said the footman and that for two reasons first because i m on the \
same side of the door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise \
inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most \
extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every \
now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces \
how am i to get in asked alice are you to get in at all said the footman that \
s the first question you know alice opened the door and went in the door led \
right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other \
the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby \
the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large caldron which seemed to \
be full of soup there s certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to \
herself as well as she could for sneezing even the duchess sneezed \
occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately \
without a moment s pause the only two creatures in the kitchen that did not \
sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was grinning from ear to ear \
please would you tell me said alice a little timidly why your cat grins like \
that it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why i didn t know that \
cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didn t know that cats could grin said \
alice you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came \
first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took \
no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much \
already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not \
oh please mind what you re doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony \
of terror here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice \
flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet \
with the queen and she hurried out of the room alice caught the baby with \
some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its \
arms and legs in all directions if i don t take this child away with me \
thought alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder \
to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing \
grunted in reply if you re going to turn into a pig my dear said alice i ll \
have nothing more to do with you mind now alice was just beginning to think \
to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it \
grunted again so violently that alice looked down into its face in some alarm \
this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less \
than a pig so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see \
it trot away quietly into the wood alice was a little startled by seeing the \
cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only \
grinned when it saw her cheshire puss began alice rather timidly would you \
please tell me which way i ought to go from here in that direction the cat \
said waving the right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving \
the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like they re both mad but i \
don t want to go among mad people alice remarked oh you can t help that said \
the cat we re all mad here do you play croquet with the queen to day i should \
like it very much said alice but i haven t been invited yet you ll see me \
there said the cat and vanished alice had not gone much farther before she \
came in sight of the house of the march hare it was so large a house that she \
did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the left hand bit \
of mushroom vii a mad tea party there was a table set out under a tree in \
front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a \
dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep the table was a large one but \
the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they \
cried out when they saw alice coming there s plenty of room said alice \
indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table the \
hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a \
raven like a writing desk i m glad they ve begun asking riddles i believe i \
can guess that she added aloud do you mean that you think you can find out \
the answer to it said the march hare exactly so said alice then you should \
say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hastily replied at least \
at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know you might just as \
well say added the dormouse which seemed to be talking in its sleep that i \
breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe it is the \
same thing with you said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its \
nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its \
eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself have you \
guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again no i give it up \
alice replied what s the answer i haven t the slightest idea said the hatter \
nor i said the march hare alice gave a weary sigh i think you might do \
something better with the time she said than wasting it in asking riddles \
that have no answers take some more tea the march hare said to alice very \
earnestly i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can t \
take more you mean you can t take less said the hatter it s very easy to take \
more than nothing at this alice got up and walked off the dormouse fell \
asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going \
though she looked back once or twice the last time she saw them they were \
trying to put the dormouse into the tea pot at any rate i ll never go there \
again said alice as she picked her way through the wood it s the stupidest \
tea party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that \
one of the trees had a door leading right into it that s very curious she \
thought i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she \
found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table taking the \
little golden key she unlocked the door that led into the garden then she set \
to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket \
till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and \
then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright \
flower beds and the cool fountains viii the queen s croquet ground a large \
rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were \
white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red suddenly \
their eyes chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them would you \
tell me please said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses \
five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why \
the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we \
put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should \
all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss we re doing our best \
afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across \
the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly \
threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps \
and alice looked round eager to see the queen first came ten soldiers \
carrying clubs with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten \
courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds after these came the \
royal children there were ten of them all ornamented with hearts next came \
the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognized the white \
rabbit then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king s crown on a \
crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king \
and the queen of hearts when the procession came opposite to alice they all \
stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it \
to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply my name is alice so \
please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why \
they re only a pack of cards after all can you play croquet shouted the queen \
the question was evidently meant for alice yes said alice loudly come on then \
roared the queen it s it s a very fine day said a timid voice to alice she \
was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face very \
said alice where s the duchess hush hush said the rabbit she s under sentence \
of execution what for said alice she boxed the queen s ears the rabbit began \
get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began \
running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they \
got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had \
never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and \
furrows the croquet balls were live hedgehogs and the mallets live flamingos \
and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and \
feet to make the arches the players all played at once without waiting for \
turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very \
short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and \
shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute they \
re dreadfully fond of beheading people here thought alice the great wonder is \
that there s anyone left alive she was looking about for some way of escape \
when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it s the cheshire cat she \
said to herself now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on \
said the cat i don t think they play at all fairly alice said in a rather \
complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself \
speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular how do you like the \
queen said the cat in a low voice not at all said alice alice thought she \
might as well go back and see how the game was going on so she went off in \
search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another \
hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of \
them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across \
to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless \
sort of way to fly up into a tree she caught the flamingo and tucked it away \
under her arm that it might not escape again just then alice ran across the \
duchess who was now out of prison she tucked her arm affectionately into \
alice s and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper she was a little startled however when she heard the voice \
of the duchess close to her ear you re thinking about something my dear and \
that makes you forget to talk the game s going on rather better now alice \
said by way of keeping up the conversation a little tis so said the duchess \
and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round \
somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding his own \
business ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her \
sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is \
take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves to alice s \
great surprise the duchess s arm that was linked into hers began to tremble \
alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms \
folded frowning like a thunderstorm now i give you fair warning shouted the \
queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off \
and that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice \
and was gone in a moment let s go on with the game the queen said to alice \
and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back \
to the croquet ground all the time they were playing the queen never left off \
quarreling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with \
her head by the end of half an hour or so all the players except the king the \
queen and alice were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of \
execution then the queen left off quite out of breath and walked away with \
alice alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you \
are all pardoned suddenly the cry the trial s beginning was heard in the \
distance and alice ran along with the others ix who stole the tarts the king \
and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a \
great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well \
as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with \
a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit \
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very \
middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it i wish \
they d get the trial done alice thought and hand round the refreshments the \
judge by the way was the king and he wore his crown over his great wig that s \
the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures some were animals and \
some were birds i suppose they are the jurors just then the white rabbit \
cried out silence in the court herald read the accusation said the king on \
this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet then unrolled the \
parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts \
all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them \
quite away call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew \
three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness the first witness \
was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and \
butter in the other you ought to have finished said the king when did you \
begin the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court \
arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it was he said give \
your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on \
the spot this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting \
from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion \
he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter just \
at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation she was beginning to grow \
larger again the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and \
went down on one knee i m a poor man your majesty he began you re a very poor \
speaker said the king you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left \
the court call the next witness said the king the next witness was the \
duchess s cook she carried the pepper box in her hand and the people near the \
door began sneezing all at once give your evidence said the king sha n t said \
the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low \
voice your majesty must cross examine this witness well if i must i must the \
king said what are tarts made of pepper mostly said the cook for some minutes \
the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled down again \
the cook had disappeared never mind said the king call the next witness alice \
watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list imagine her surprise \
when he read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice x alice \
s evidence here cried alice she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury box upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay the trial \
cannot proceed said the king until all the jurymen are back in their proper \
places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice what do you \
know about this business the king said to alice nothing whatever said alice \
the king then read from his book rule forty two all persons more than a mile \
high to leave the court i m not a mile high said alice nearly two miles high \
said the queen well i sha n t go at any rate said alice the king turned pale \
and shut his note book hastily consider your verdict he said to the jury in a \
low trembling voice there s more evidence to come yet please your majesty \
said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been \
picked up it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody he \
unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a \
set of verses please your majesty said the knave i didn t write it and they \
can t prove that i did there s no name signed at the end you must have meant \
some mischief or else you d have signed your name like an honest man said the \
king there was a general clapping of hands at this read them he added turning \
to the white rabbit there was dead silence in the court whilst the white \
rabbit read out the verses that s the most important piece of evidence we ve \
heard yet said the king i don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it \
ventured alice if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a world \
of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any let the jury consider their \
verdict no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards stuff and \
nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence first hold your \
tongue said the queen turning purple i won t said alice off with her head the \
queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody moved who cares for you said \
alice she had grown to her full size by this time you re nothing but a pack \
of cards at this the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon \
her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to \
beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of \
her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered \
down from the trees upon her face wake up alice dear said her sister why what \
a long sleep you ve had oh i ve had such a curious dream said alice and she \
told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange \
adventures of hers that you have just been reading about alice got up and ran \
off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had \
